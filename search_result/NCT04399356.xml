    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the antihelmintic drug, Niclosamide, as a potential treatment for&#xD;
      mild to moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Niclosamide, which has potent antiviral activity against single-stranded RNA viruses&#xD;
      including coronaviruses, was proposed as an antiviral during the Severe Acute Respiratory&#xD;
      Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002 and has activity including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome&#xD;
      Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) where it was found to inhibit SARS coronavirus, SARS-CoV, in in&#xD;
      vitro studies and similarly structured RNA viruses (both in vitro and in vivo). The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that the antiviral activity of Niclosamide may be extended to&#xD;
      COVID-19.&#xD;

        <time_frame>Reduction in viral shedding as measured by oropharyngeal swab on days, 3, 7, 10, 14.</time_frame>
        <population>We evaluated efficacy of niclosamide in shortening contagious period as determined by time to oropharyngeal viral clearance. Primary analysis was based on ITT population (all randomized participants). The cumulative probability of being in clearance in each randomization group was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. The cumulative probability of clearance at day 3 between the groups was calculated using a chi-square test based on a log(- log(·)) transformation for the survival function.</population>
