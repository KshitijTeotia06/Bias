  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of APL-9 in adults with&#xD;
      mild to moderate ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) caused by COVID-19 who are&#xD;
      hospitalized and require supplemental oxygen therapy with or without mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is thought that COVID-19 activates the complement system, part of the immune system that&#xD;
      responds to infection or tissue damage, and increases inflammation in the lungs. APL-9 has&#xD;
      been designed to inhibit or block activation of part of the complement pathway, and&#xD;
      potentially reduce inflammation in the lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 of the study is open-label to evaluate safety; all participants will receive APL-9&#xD;
      plus standard of care. Part 2 of the study is double-blind, randomized; participants will&#xD;
      receive either APL-9 or the vehicle-control plus standard of care.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Subjects Who Experienced Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious TEAEs</measure>
    <time_frame>From the first dose of study drug and up to 30 (+7) days after the last dose of study drug. Part 1: Day 1 up to Day 44; Part 2: Day 1 up to Day 58</time_frame>
    <description>TEAEs were defined as those adverse events that developed or worsened in severity after initiation of the first dose of study drug and up to 30 (+7) days beyond the last dose of study drug. A serious TEAE was any TEAE or suspected adverse reaction that, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; is life threatening; inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions; or a congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

For subjects with death of any cause (or withdrawal of study participation), total duration of mechanical ventilation was imputed with the longest duration observed in the study. Any subject who was not on mechanical ventilation at the randomization date was excluded. Median total duration of mechanical ventilation was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Duration of Oxygen Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Part 2: Day 1 up to Day 58</time_frame>
    <description>Total duration of oxygen therapy was calculated from randomization date and was defined as days on mechanical ventilation or supplemental oxygen during the study participation. For subjects with death of any cause (or withdrawal of study participation), total duration of oxygen therapy was imputed with the longest duration observed in the study. Any subject who was not on mechanical ventilation or supplemental oxygen at the randomization date was excluded. Median total duration of oxygen therapy was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This was a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group Phase 1/2 study (with an initial open-label period) evaluating the safety and efficacy of APL-9 versus (vs) vehicle control as an add-on therapy to standard of care (SoC) in subjects who had respiratory failure, including mild to moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The study was conducted in 2 parts: Subjects in Part 1 received open-label APL-9 from Day 1 through Day 7 or resolution of ARDS. Subjects in Part 2 were randomly assigned 1:1 to blinded treatment with either APL-9 or vehicle control from Day 1 through Day 7 or up to and including Day 21, discontinuation of respiratory support or hospital discharge, whichever occurred latest. Extended treatment beyond Day 7 in Part 2 required certain criteria to be met and was at discretion of the Investigator.</pre_assignment_details>

The minimum value is 0 and maximum value is 24. Higher scores indicate worse outcomes. A subject with a SOFA score of zero was defined as being free of organ failure.</description>
          <population>The FAS included all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. The analyses using the FAS were based upon the actual treatment allocated. Analysis was pre-specified in Part 2 only. Only subjects with values at both Baseline and the specified visit were included in the analysis.</population>

          <title>Serum Concentration of APL-9 Over Time</title>
          <description>To evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK), blood samples were collected at pre-specified timepoints and serum concentrations of APL-9 were determined. Blood was collected 3 times on Day 1: prior to the initial infusion, as soon as possible following the initial infusion (within 5-10 minutes) prior to the continuous infusion, and at 2 hours after the beginning of the continuous infusion. Blood was then collected once daily between 1-2 hours after the first dose on Days 3, 5, 7, 11 (if treatment was ongoing), Day 15 (if treatment was ongoing) and at the EOT visit.</description>
          <population>The PK set included all subjects in the safety set and for whom at least 1 PK sample was evaluable.</population>

        <description>To evaluate PD parameters, blood samples were collected at pre-specified timepoints. Results are presented for change from baseline to EOT visit for complement biomarkers C3a, C4a, C5a and TCC.</description>
        <time_frame>Part 1: Baseline (Day 1) and EOT visit (up to Day 7); Part 2: Baseline (Day 1) and EOT visit (up to Day 21)</time_frame>
        <population>The PD set included all subjects in the safety set with at least 1 PD evaluation. Note: C5a was only measured in Part 2 because this biomarker was added in APL9-COV-201 Protocol Amendment 2 which was after the last subject in Part 1 finished the last study dose. Only subjects with values at both Baseline and the EOT visit were included in the analysis.</population>

          <description>To evaluate PD parameters, blood samples were collected at pre-specified timepoints. Results are presented for change from baseline to EOT visit for the coagulation biomarker reticulocytes. Percentage (%) of reticulocytes was calculated as (Number of Reticulocytes / Number of Red Blood Cells) X 100.</description>
          <population>The PD set included all subjects in the safety set with at least 1 PD evaluation. Only subjects with values at both Baseline and the EOT visit were included in the analysis.</population>
