  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 infection is the cause of the current pandemic, responsible for loss of life and&#xD;
      disability at a rate unseen before. Among survivors, the infection may cause lasting damage,&#xD;
      such as permanent loss of lung function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate if pulmonary rehabilitation done via supportive devices may&#xD;
      reduce or prevent lung function injury. Patients will be chosen among COVID-19 patients who&#xD;
      require hospitalization. Patients then will be divided into two groups, those who had used&#xD;
      said devices, and compare them to those who had not used them for any reason. After a month,&#xD;
      two groups will be evaluated by respiratory function tests, which are expected to provide the&#xD;
      results required for a proper comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary rehabilitation provided by the supportive devices is expected to either lessen or&#xD;
      eliminate a loss of pulmonary function over time, compared to the group who did not use them.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that is responsible for the current pandemic. Its clinical&#xD;
      presentation varies from asymptomatic infection to severe respiratory failure requiring&#xD;
      intensive care stay. Loss of respiratory function had been observed in survivors of other&#xD;
      coronaviruses in earlier studies. The degree of respiratory function loss and if any&#xD;
      intervention may reduce or prevent it remains an issue to be clarified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study's goal is to investigate the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation via a supporting&#xD;
      device on COVID-19 patients during a follow-up period of one month. The primary method of&#xD;
      investigation of pulmonary functions is comparing peak expiratory flow (PEF) at the time of&#xD;
      diagnosis and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesizes that patients who had successfully used a respiratory exerciser or a&#xD;
      similar aid device will have better PEF results at the end of the first-month evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of an incentive spirometer and/or a respiratory exerciser on the pulmonary&#xD;
      function results is the main element under investigation in this study. The hospital provides&#xD;
      these devices, and in cases, patients demand another device, the patients and their relatives&#xD;
      are asked to purchase such equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary function tests (PFT) are considered a part of routine evaluation for the COVID-19&#xD;
      patients a month after the treatment. Patients are considered suitable for PFT evaluation if&#xD;
      the COVID-19 infectious process is deemed treated, and other contraindications for PFT are&#xD;
      not present, such as recent surgery or pneumothorax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients admitted to the pulmonary medicine ward for COVID-19 infection are generally those&#xD;
      who already have respiratory comorbidity, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,&#xD;
      asthma, concurrent pneumonia, and respiratory failure. Due to these reasons, PFT is not&#xD;
      considered an acceptable evaluation method during the acute phase and is not requested. PEF&#xD;
      testing, on the other hand, remains a simple yet effective alternative compared to PFT due to&#xD;
      being more portable, the presence of disposable parts, and overall cost. It is the initial&#xD;
      choice of evaluation for patients after a clinical response is seen to treatment and testing&#xD;
      is deemed safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The respiratory exercise is considered a part of COVID-19 care, primarily due to patients'&#xD;
      comorbidities, as mentioned above. This approach is limited in terms of healthcare personnel&#xD;
      for on-point pulmonary rehabilitation due to both the disease's infectious nature and limited&#xD;
      resources. Respiratory exercise devices are accepted as a reasonable alternative that can be&#xD;
      quantitively monitored and provided on a daily basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective study plans to evaluate the impact of respiratory exercise provided by&#xD;
      incentive spirometers and respiratory exercisers. The evaluation will be performed by&#xD;
      comparing the initial PEF result after the end of COVID-19 treatment and subsequent ward&#xD;
      discharge; to the PEF result of the PFT evaluation at the end of the first month.&#xD;

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Discharge to Follow-up Duration (Days)</measure>
    <time_frame>The time frame for &quot;Discharge to Follow-up Duration&quot; consisted of up to two months post-baseline evaluation. When a patient had arrived for the first follow-up evaluation, the time difference between baseline evaluation and this re-evaluation was noted.</time_frame>
    <description>The duration between the baseline evaluation at the time of hospital discharge and the first follow-up is defined as &quot;Discharge to Follow-up Duration&quot;. There happens a time difference between post-one month evaluation and this definition, due to appointment dates; the exact one month time for a patient happening to be within weekend days or due to delays in respiratory testing. This could be observed by the time range of patients given here, as some (as seen in patients arriving within 13 days) had come to the hospital earlier, while some ( in the other end of the group, such as those arriving at 41st day) had either arrived late or could not be evaluated with respiratory function testing due to appointment or testing issues up to the day mentioned.</description>

          <title>Charlson Comorbidity Index</title>
          <description>Charlson Comorbidity Index is utilized for the evaluation of the total severity of comorbidities present on a patient. It calculates an estimated ten years survival rate, based on a point scale, with higher scores having increased overall mortality. The scale ranges beings from 0 points (98% ten years survival ) with 7 points presented with 0% 10 years survival, with the theoretical upper limit being 31 points (accumulation of all possible comorbidities). For this study's interest, 1 point presents with 96%, 2 with 90%, 3 with 77%, and 4 with 55% survival rate (highest score observed here)</description>

          <title>Peak Expiratory Flow (Hospital Discharge)</title>
          <description>Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) is calculated by personal handheld devices given to the patients. The initial testing was performed at the time of hospital discharge, for which afterward respiratory exerciser was requested of the patients. This initial PEF value is accepted as the baseline measure for which the comparison was made at the follow-up (which was defined as the first evaluation performed one month after hospital discharge). The normal PEF range in ml/min depends on the patient's age and gender, with an estimated average of 571 ml/min in a 20-year-old, 175 cm male.</description>

          <description>The initial oxygen requirement is defined as the oxygenation required for a patient to be considered stable (a saturation % of 90 or above) at the time of the first day of hospital admission. The categorization is made according to the delivery methods, with each method providing a certain oxygen flow. Nasal support includes 0-4 liter/min, mask category includes a support level of 4-10 l/min, and high flow definition supports any l/min above 10 l/min. Due to the study design of respiratory testing being performed at hospital discharge, these parameters were accepted as baseline results.</description>

          <title>Forced Vital Capacity (FVC)</title>
          <description>Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) result of the pulmonary function testing was to be used as a pulmonary function parameter. It was performed via standard office spirometry. It was calculated as an absolute value (in liters) and as a percentage (compared to the normal population data) It was to be used as a validation method to ensure patients did not have a former yet undiagnosed respiratory disease and to validate the presence of abnormal Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) values.</description>
          <population>Due to cooperation difficulties and/or differences above 10% in repeated testing, a total of 6 patients were excluded from the FVC evaluation.</population>

        <description>The duration between the baseline evaluation at the time of hospital discharge and the first follow-up is defined as &quot;Discharge to Follow-up Duration&quot;. There happens a time difference between post-one month evaluation and this definition, due to appointment dates; the exact one month time for a patient happening to be within weekend days or due to delays in respiratory testing. This could be observed by the time range of patients given here, as some (as seen in patients arriving within 13 days) had come to the hospital earlier, while some ( in the other end of the group, such as those arriving at 41st day) had either arrived late or could not be evaluated with respiratory function testing due to appointment or testing issues up to the day mentioned.</description>
        <time_frame>The time frame for &quot;Discharge to Follow-up Duration&quot; consisted of up to two months post-baseline evaluation. When a patient had arrived for the first follow-up evaluation, the time difference between baseline evaluation and this re-evaluation was noted.</time_frame>

      <time_frame>The adverse event data were collected between the hospital admission time and the follow-up evaluation date. The follow-up evaluation was performed one month after hospital discharge and the median hospitalization duration was 8 days (3-18 full range). This accounts for a minimum of 33 days for the patient with the short follow-up and 48 days for the longest follow-up, regarding adverse data collection.</time_frame>
