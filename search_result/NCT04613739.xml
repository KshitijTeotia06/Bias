  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In addition to its impact on health, the COVID-19 pandemic led to increased unemployment and&#xD;
      loss of employer-sponsored insurance coverage. Obtaining coverage can be challenging and&#xD;
      eligibility for public programs and subsidies can be limited, and those who do not qualify&#xD;
      can face steep premiums, high-deductibles, and high out-of-pocket costs. Disruptions to&#xD;
      employment and insurance coverage during the pandemic threaten to negatively affect asthma&#xD;
      care and outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our parent project, Asthma in Families Facing Out-of-pocket Requirements with Deductibles&#xD;
      (AFFORD), found that patients with asthma may be particularly vulnerable to insurance-related&#xD;
      cost barriers and challenges navigating health insurance. Together with the Asthma and&#xD;
      Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA), the investigators developed an asthma chat bot to help&#xD;
      patients with asthma navigate insurance benefits and optimize health care decisions. The chat&#xD;
      bot is an artificial intelligence-enabled interactive online tool that can answer clinical&#xD;
      and insurance-related questions and provide information on coverage and how to find&#xD;
      lower-cost alternatives for asthma care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this supplement to the AFFORD project, the investigators propose a new study to understand&#xD;
      and address the insurance and health care cost challenges faced by patients with asthma who&#xD;
      lose employer-sponsored coverage due to COVID-19. Our Aims are: 1) to conduct a pilot&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility and acceptability&#xD;
      of an insurance navigation intervention, including the chat bot, to help patients with asthma&#xD;
      regain coverage after the loss of job-related insurance during the COVID-19 pandemic; and 2)&#xD;
      to qualitatively explore the experiences of Aim 1 participants to understand barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators to accessing coverage and asthma care more broadly during the COVID-19 pandemic&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that participants receiving the intervention will be more likely to&#xD;
      have coverage after four months and less likely to report non-adherence to asthma&#xD;
      medications, delayed/forgone asthma care, and financial burden than those receiving usual&#xD;
      care. Findings will provide evidence about the effectiveness of strategies to obtain coverage&#xD;
      and maintain access to affordable asthma care and can inform ongoing and future decision&#xD;
      making in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and other public health and economic threats.&#xD;

      In addition to its impact on health, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased unemployment&#xD;
      and loss of employer-sponsored insurance coverage. Obtaining coverage can be challenging and&#xD;
      eligibility for public programs and subsidies can be limited, and those who do not qualify&#xD;
      can face steep premiums, high-deductibles, and high out-of-pocket costs. Disruptions to&#xD;
      employment and insurance coverage during the pandemic threaten to negatively affect asthma&#xD;
      care and outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our parent project, Asthma in Families Facing Out-of-pocket Requirements with Deductibles&#xD;
      (AFFORD), found that patients with asthma may be particularly vulnerable to insurance-related&#xD;
      cost barriers and challenges navigating health insurance. Together with the Asthma and&#xD;
      Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA), investigators developed an asthma chat bot to help&#xD;

      bot is an artificial intelligence-enabled interactive online tool that can answer&#xD;
      insurance-related questions and provide information on coverage and how to find lower-cost&#xD;
      alternatives for asthma care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this supplement, the investigators propose to capitalize on the work of AFFORD to&#xD;
      understand and address the insurance and health care cost challenges faced by patients with&#xD;
      asthma who lose employer-sponsored coverage due to COVID-19. Specifically, our Aims are: 1)&#xD;
      to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness and&#xD;
      implementation outcomes (e.g. feasibility, acceptability) of an existing insurance navigation&#xD;
      intervention, including the chat bot, to help patients with asthma regain coverage after the&#xD;
      loss of job-related insurance during the COVID-19 pandemic; 2) to qualitatively explore the&#xD;
      experiences of Aim 1 participants to understand barriers and facilitators to accessing&#xD;
      coverage and asthma care more broadly during the COVID-19 pandemic&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings will provide evidence about the effectiveness of patient-centered technological&#xD;
      strategies to obtain coverage and maintain access to affordable asthma care and can inform&#xD;
      ongoing and future decision making in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and other public&#xD;
      health and economic threats.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be recruited through the AAFA and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care. As in&#xD;
      AFFORD, the proposed study will take advantage of AAFA's wide national reach and role as a&#xD;
      trusted information source to recruit a national sample of patients with asthma or parents of&#xD;
      children with asthma. We will also recruit through Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, a non-profit&#xD;
      health plan that offers insurance plans in Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, and&#xD;
      Connecticut&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this aim, the investigators will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of patients&#xD;
      with asthma or parents of children with asthma who lost employer-sponsored coverage during&#xD;
      the COVID-19 pandemic. Potential study subjects will be recruited through AAFA and Harvard&#xD;
      Pilgrim. Eligible participants will be randomized into one of two study groups: 1) an&#xD;
      intervention group that receives access to an asthma chat bot and personalized insurance&#xD;
      navigation (n=145), or 2) a wait-list control group (n=285). At study entry, participants&#xD;
      will receive an online baseline survey to assess outcomes related to insurance coverage,&#xD;
      asthma severity and control, medication use and adherence, asthma care access and&#xD;
      affordability, and COVID-19 related illness. The intervention group will be offered the chat&#xD;
      bot and AAFA navigation services. One month later, the investigators will field a follow-up&#xD;
      survey to measure short-term changes in outcomes; for the intervention group, this survey&#xD;
      will also measure implementation outcomes including uptake, feasibility, acceptability, and&#xD;
      usability. Four months later, the investigators will field a second follow-up survey to&#xD;
      measure longer-term changes in outcomes. Control subjects will be offered the chat bot after&#xD;
      completion of the follow-up surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will include adults aged 18-64 years who have asthma or have a child with&#xD;
      asthma aged 4-17 years, and lost employer-sponsored health insurance after February 2020.&#xD;
      Potential subjects will be recruited through AAFA, who will send out a description of the&#xD;
      study to potential subjects through its online community, email listserv, website, Facebook&#xD;
      page, and newsletter. Potential subjects will also be recruited through Harvard Pilgrim.&#xD;
      Members who disenrolled from employer-sponsored plans after February 2020 will be identified,&#xD;
      and those aged 4-64 with an International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 diagnosis code&#xD;
      for asthma in claims data after January 1, 2019 will be contacted by email and invited to&#xD;
      participate. The investigators will collect information on race/ethnicity and select a sample&#xD;
      representative of the racial/ethnic distribution of patients with asthma, with no more than&#xD;
      60% non-Hispanic White participants selected for the sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial where they will randomize&#xD;
      participants who lost coverage to: 1) be offered a combination of automated chat bot and&#xD;
      personalized outreach provided by AAFA-affiliated navigators (n=145), or 2) be a wait-list&#xD;
      control (n=285). The investigators will use a wait-list, usual care control group as the&#xD;
      comparator given that there is no other standard treatment or practice for people with asthma&#xD;
      who lose insurance coverage to which to compare our navigation intervention. After&#xD;
      randomization, participants will be given a RedCap link for a baseline survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the baseline survey, intervention subjects will be sent an email with&#xD;
      information about AAFA's asthma chat bot and a link to access it and information about AAFA's&#xD;
      insurance navigation program, how it can help with finding coverage and managing asthma&#xD;
      costs, and how to access it via group and private messaging within AAFA's asthma community&#xD;
      platform with the availability of telephonic follow-up from AAFA navigators. Subjects can&#xD;
      join the private group where they can ask questions and share resources. They will be able to&#xD;
      send messages to the AAFA navigator to communicate about insurance issues, access to asthma&#xD;
      care, and assistance with asthma costs. The navigator will offer telephonic follow-up as&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One month after receiving the intervention, subjects will be emailed a RedCap link to a&#xD;
      follow-up survey to measure changes in insurance coverage and other outcomes. The follow-up&#xD;
      survey will be structured similarly to the baseline survey, with closed-ended questions about&#xD;
      insurance coverage, asthma care and control, health care access and affordability. For&#xD;
      intervention subjects, the follow-up survey will also ask closed and open-ended questions&#xD;
      about implementation outcomes such as uptake, acceptability, feasibility, usability, and&#xD;
      fidelity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four months later, intervention and control subjects will be emailed a RedCap link to a&#xD;
      similar follow-up survey to measure changes in insurance coverage, asthma care and control,&#xD;
      health care access, and affordability. Survey subjects will be asked for permission to be&#xD;
      contacted again for participation in a telephone interview for Aim 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be whether the participant with asthma (or their child with asthma)&#xD;
      has insurance coverage. Secondary outcomes will include whether the person with asthma used&#xD;
      less asthma medication than prescribed because of cost, and whether they experienced health&#xD;
      care-related financial burden. Other outcomes will assess asthma care use, asthma control&#xD;
      using the Asthma Control Test (ACT), health status, mental health/worry, and material&#xD;
      hardships such as food or housing insecurity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that participants receiving the intervention will be more likely to&#xD;
      have coverage at four-month follow up (primary outcome) and will be less likely to report&#xD;
      non-adherence to asthma medications, delayed/forgone asthma care, and financial burden than&#xD;
      those receiving usual care (secondary outcomes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will compare unadjusted outcomes between the intervention and control&#xD;
      groups using chi square and t tests; because of the randomized study design this difference&#xD;
      measures the causal impact of the intervention. They will conduct post hoc exploratory&#xD;
      analysis to assess differences in intervention effectiveness by race/ethnicity to assess&#xD;
      whether the intervention reduces racial/ethnic coverage disparities. Given the small pilot&#xD;
      nature of this study, these analyses will be hypothesis-generating rather than&#xD;
      hypothesis-testing. In this pilot study, efficacy testing will be limited but the&#xD;
      investigators expect to have 100 intervention and 200 control subjects with follow-up data to&#xD;
      be able to detect absolute differences of 10% or more between study groups in changes in&#xD;
      uninsurance rates with 80% power with a two-tailed alpha of 0.05. The investigators assume&#xD;
      30% loss to follow-up from baseline to four-month follow-up. Given the small pilot nature of&#xD;
      this study, dropout will be carefully tracked in order to inform feasibility assessment and&#xD;
      planning for a larger trial. The investigators will closely monitor timing of dropout, impact&#xD;
      of strategies such as telephone outreach, and characteristics of those dropping out compared&#xD;
      to those retained, and will use multiple imputation methods to conduct a sensitivity analysis&#xD;
      to test the sensitivity of findings analyzed with and without imputed data. Findings will be&#xD;
      reported using CONSORT reporting guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this aim, the investigators will conduct in-depth qualitative interviews to better&#xD;
      understand barriers and facilitators to accessing coverage and asthma care more broadly&#xD;
      during the COVID-19 pandemic. Study subjects will be selected from among those who completed&#xD;
      the follow-up survey and gave permission to be re-contacted for a telephone interview. The&#xD;
      investigators will approach 100 eligible survey participants by email to invite them to&#xD;
      participate in an interview. They expect to complete 30 phone interviews, half from the&#xD;
      intervention group and half from the control group. Interviews will use open-ended questions&#xD;
      to explore patients' experiences related to obtaining coverage after job loss and associated&#xD;
      asthma care access and affordability challenges and facilitators. Interviews will be&#xD;
      conducted by the study investigators and will be audio recorded and the recordings will be&#xD;
      transcribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be intervention and control participants who complete the&#xD;
      four-month follow-up survey, give permission to be re-contacted for an interview, and provide&#xD;
      an email and/or phone number to use to contact them. The investigators will seek to maximize&#xD;
      variation in our sample by using survey data to identify potential subjects with a range of&#xD;
      races/ethnicities, incomes, geographic residences, ages (child vs adult), and asthma&#xD;
      severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will collect data from 30 study participants through in-depth qualitative&#xD;
      interviews. They will approach 100 eligible survey participants by email to invite them to&#xD;
      participate in an interview. They will then follow up by phone to schedule an interview.&#xD;
      After scheduling a telephone interview and describing the study, they will obtain verbal&#xD;
      informed consent. Interviews will last for approximately 45 minutes and will be audio&#xD;
      recorded with permission and transcribed verbatim. They estimate completing 30 phone&#xD;
      interviews, half with participants from the intervention group and half from the control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will transcribe recordings of the interviews and analyze these data via&#xD;
      thematic content analysis. Using a codebook, 2 trained coders will independently code&#xD;
      transcripts using NVivo, resolving disagreements via discussion. They will describe data&#xD;
      thematically to probe quantitative findings and describe strengths, weaknesses, and perceived&#xD;
      intervention impact.&#xD;
