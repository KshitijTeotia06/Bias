  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase 2/3 study to assess the efficacy about therapeutic effect of CT-P59 to the&#xD;
      mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and the safety during after study drug&#xD;
      injection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CT-P59 is a human monoclonal antibody targeted against severe acute respiratory syndrome&#xD;
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein as a treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is&#xD;
      manufactured by recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid technology in a Chinese hamster ovary&#xD;
      mammalian cell line. This Phase 2/3, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      double-blind study was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and therapeutic&#xD;
      potential of CT-P59 in outpatients with mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection, not requiring&#xD;
      supplemental oxygen therapy.&#xD;

Clinical recovery was defined as all symptoms on the SARS-CoV-2 Infection Symptom Checklist 1 being recorded as 'absent' or 'mild' in intensity for at least 48 hours. SARS-CoV-2 Infection Symptom Checklist 1 consisted of 7 symptoms (feeling feverish, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, sore throat, body pain or muscle pain, fatigue, and headache) and the intensity of patient's self-aware for each SARS-CoV-2 infection symptom (absent [0], mild [1]. moderate [2], and severe [3]).&#xD;
To meet the clinical recovery, symptoms 'severe' or 'moderate' in intensity at baseline should be changed to 'mild' or 'absent', or symptoms 'mild' in intensity at baseline should be changed to 'absent', after the study drug administration. Symptoms &quot;absent&quot; in intensity at baseline should maintain as &quot;absent&quot; for at least 48 hours.</description>

Clinical recovery was defined as all symptoms on the SARS-CoV-2 Infection Symptom Checklist 1 being recorded as 'absent' or 'mild' in intensity for at least 48 hours. SARS-CoV-2 Infection Symptom Checklist 1 consisted of 7 symptoms (feeling feverish, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, sore throat, body pain or muscle pain, fatigue, and headache) and the intensity of patient's self-aware for each SARS-CoV-2 infection symptom (absent [0], mild [1]. moderate [2], and severe [3]).&#xD;
To meet the clinical recovery, symptoms 'severe' or 'moderate' in intensity at baseline should be changed to 'mild' or 'absent', or symptoms 'mild' in intensity at baseline should be changed to 'absent', after the study drug administration. Symptoms &quot;absent&quot; in intensity at baseline should maintain as &quot;absent&quot; for at least 48 hours.</description>

Clinical recovery was defined as all symptoms on the SARS-CoV-2 Infection Symptom Checklist 1 being recorded as 'absent' or 'mild' in intensity for at least 48 hours. SARS-CoV-2 Infection Symptom Checklist 1 consisted of 7 symptoms (feeling feverish, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, sore throat, body pain or muscle pain, fatigue, and headache) and the intensity of patient's self-aware for each SARS-CoV-2 infection symptom (absent [0], mild [1]. moderate [2], and severe [3]).&#xD;
To meet the clinical recovery, symptoms 'severe' or 'moderate' in intensity at baseline should be changed to 'mild' or 'absent', or symptoms 'mild' in intensity at baseline should be changed to 'absent', after the study drug administration. Symptoms &quot;absent&quot; in intensity at baseline should maintain as &quot;absent&quot; for at least 48 hours.</description>

        <title>Time to Clinical Recovery (Part 1 and Part 2)</title>
        <description>To evaluate the additional efficacy of CT-P59. Clinical recovery was defined as all symptoms on the SARS-CoV-2 Infection Symptom Checklist 1 being recorded as 'absent' or 'mild' in intensity for at least 48 hours. SARS-CoV-2 Infection Symptom Checklist 1 consisted of 7 symptoms (feeling feverish, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, sore throat, body pain or muscle pain, fatigue, and headache) and the intensity of patient's self-aware for each SARS-CoV-2 infection symptom (absent [0], mild [1]. moderate [2], and severe [3]).&#xD;
To meet the clinical recovery, symptoms 'severe' or 'moderate' in intensity at baseline should be changed to 'mild' or 'absent', or symptoms 'mild' in intensity at baseline should be changed to 'absent', after the study drug administration. Symptoms &quot;absent&quot; in intensity at baseline should maintain as &quot;absent&quot; for at least 48 hours.</description>
