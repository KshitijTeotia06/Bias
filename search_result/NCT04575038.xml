  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the efficacy and safety of DHODHi (brequinar) as an antiviral via 5&#xD;
      days of treatment of participants with positive COVID-19 and at least one symptom of COVI019&#xD;
      in an out-patient setting. The study is multi-center, randomized, and placebo-controlled.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brequinar is a potent DHODH inhibitor that has been previously studied in more than 1,000&#xD;
      cancer, psoriasis, and organ transplant patients. Brequinar has been found to have potent in&#xD;
      vitro antiviral activity against many RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2. The antiviral&#xD;
      activity of brequinar against SARS-CoV-2 is likely due to DHODH inhibition and shows&#xD;
      nanomolar potency and a high selectivity index in inhibiting viral replication in in vitro&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CRISIS2 trial will study out-patients (non-hospitalized patients) who have a positive&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 test and are symptomatic. Subjects will be randomized to receive standard of care&#xD;
      (SOC) + 5 days of brequinar or SOC + 5 days of placebo. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      determine if the in vitro antiviral activity of brequinar can be duplicated in patients&#xD;
      infected with SARS-CoV-2 by measuring the effect of brequinar on viral shedding. Importantly,&#xD;
      the safety and tolerability of brequinar will also be determined in these patients. The&#xD;
      results of this proof-of-concept study will inform future studies that will help determine if&#xD;
      brequinar is a safe and effective drug for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a phase II randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, multi-center study with&#xD;
      approximately 100 subjects. All subjects will receive standard of care (SOC) per&#xD;
      institutional guidelines for treatment of patients with COVID-19 infection. In addition to&#xD;
      SOC, the subjects will self-administer one capsule once daily for 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have a Screening Visit followed as soon as possible with Study Day 1. Study&#xD;
      visits (virtual or in person) will take place at Screening and on specified days. The visits&#xD;
      that include bloodwork must be conducted at the study site or arrangements made for sample&#xD;
      collection at the subject's home or other appropriate location. Other visits/visit activities&#xD;
      for that visit may be conducted remotely using telemedicine or other remote technique.&#xD;
      Subjects are to self-collect a viral load sample, obtain their respiratory rate, heart rate,&#xD;
      body temperature and SpO2, and complete a symptom assessment checklist on specified days.&#xD;

      <recruitment_details>Subjects were all confirmed to be positive for COVID-19 by means of either a rapid antigen or RT-PCR test. Subjects were out-patients (not hospitalized) at the time of study entry. The first subject was enrolled on 19-NOV-2020; the last subject completed the study on 29-MAR-2021.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 182 subjects were screened for the study at 14 centers in the US. The Screening period was not more than 7 days in order to provide subjects the earliest possible opportunity for antiviral treatment. The primary screen fail reason was failure to meet one of the laboratory eligibility criteria including low hemoglobin, low platelets, low neutrophil count, and elevated liver function test. Qualifying subjects were enrolled into the study and randomized on the same day.</pre_assignment_details>
