      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate and improve a rapid COVID-19 test. The test&#xD;
      is designed to identify people who are most contagious and likely to spread the virus to&#xD;
      others. This test will be performed at various locations in the Madison area using a mobile&#xD;
      laboratory or standard lab space for processing. Saliva samples can be collected and&#xD;
      processed at these locations or participants can self-collect at home and drop their samples&#xD;
      off at designated locations for same day processing. Results of potential findings of&#xD;
      clinical significance will be communicated to the participants by a physician with&#xD;
      appropriate expertise on the study team. Individuals with a potential finding of clinical&#xD;
      significance will be encouraged to self-isolate and obtain a diagnostic test at their&#xD;
      earliest convenience. No results will be given if the test is negative. If the participant&#xD;
      consents, advanced molecular testing such as PCR or viral sequencing can be done and results&#xD;
      can be shared via online databases, presentations and publications along with the date, site&#xD;
      and county of collection to help facilitate tracking the spread of the virus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Virtually all COVID-19 RNA assays require centralized laboratories. Samples collected in&#xD;
      locations including public testing sites, workplaces, nursing homes, and residential housing&#xD;
      are transported to centralized laboratories for testing, leading to lengthy delays in results&#xD;
      reporting. The window of maximal contagiousness is thought to be only a few days, so these&#xD;
      delays create the risk of excess transmission. Current testing methods are painful, which&#xD;
      encourages testing hesitancy. Rapid, onsite detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from non-invasive&#xD;
      saliva could overcome these issues and provide a pathway to high-throughput detection of&#xD;
      people at the greatest risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission but the logistics of such a testing&#xD;
      program require real-world prototyping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have developed a simple test to detect high concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 in&#xD;
      saliva with assays that require no specialized equipment and can be completed in one hour.&#xD;
      This assay is not diagnostic for SARS-CoV-2; instead, it specifically identifies saliva&#xD;
      samples that have high amounts of viral RNA that are correlated with live virus shedding.&#xD;
      Many samples that would be identified as SARS-CoV-2 by diagnostic qRT-PCR would be negative&#xD;
      with this saliva assay. Conversely, detection of RNA in saliva is a potential finding of&#xD;
      clinical significance, so participants with that result will be contacted by a medical&#xD;
      professional to discuss potential follow-up with their own health care provider, including a&#xD;
      possible independent diagnostic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the assay requires no specialized equipment, it can be performed at the site of&#xD;
      sample collection using a portable laboratory that fits in the backseat of a car. The&#xD;
      prototype testing will take place in a variety of settings that may include parking lots,&#xD;
      workplaces, nursing homes and residential housing. Participants will be asked to consent to&#xD;
      provide a saliva sample that will be tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels consistent with live&#xD;
      virus shedding. The consent document will explicitly state that this is not a diagnostic test&#xD;
      for SARS-CoV-2 but that a potential finding of clinical significance should be discussed with&#xD;
      a medical professional. Participants can opt-out of receiving any results at the time of&#xD;
      consent and can provide samples for the sole purpose of contributing to community&#xD;
      surveillance and assay development. Paper consent forms will be reviewed and signed and held&#xD;
      by team members in a secure location (locked box at the collection site) until taken back to&#xD;
      the AIDS Vaccine Research Laboratory for storage. Participants will then spit into a coded&#xD;
      vessel (e.g., cup or tube). Samples should be at least 1ml (~Â¼ teaspoon) and will be assayed&#xD;
      for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using the aforementioned detection assay; the presence of&#xD;
      high concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA is indicated by a colorimetric change from pink to&#xD;
      yellow/orange.&#xD;
