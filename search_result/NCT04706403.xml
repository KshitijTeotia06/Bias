  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to develop evidence-based messages that effectively mitigate&#xD;
      concerns of people at risk for not being vaccinated against COVID-19, with the ultimate goal&#xD;
      of maximizing vaccine uptake in vulnerable populations. The investigators will collect data&#xD;
      on COVID-19 disease and vaccine knowledge, beliefs, and intent to be vaccinated from an&#xD;
      existing online panel. Results from this data collection will be used to develop effective&#xD;
      messages and communication strategies. The investigators will test alternate versions of&#xD;
      messages intended to reduce vaccine hesitancy and promote vaccine uptake among&#xD;
      vaccine-hesitant individuals. This project will ultimately result in a set of tested,&#xD;
      evidence-derived messages about vaccination for COVID-19.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly instigated a&#xD;
      global pandemic. As of this writing, there are approximately 65 million documented cases of&#xD;
      infection worldwide, and over 1.5 million deaths. In the United States (US), coronavirus&#xD;
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) has disrupted the economy, overwhelmed healthcare system, led to&#xD;
      widespread school cancellations, and caused more than 274,000 deaths since March 2020. A&#xD;
      vaccine against COVID-19 is widely viewed as the key to controlling the pandemic and enabling&#xD;
      a return to &quot;normal&quot; life. Vaccine development is proceeding at an unprecedented pace with 10&#xD;
      vaccines currently in phase 3 trials. Experts have projected that a safe and effective&#xD;
      vaccine may be available by mid-2021. At the same time, a growing body of evidence indicates&#xD;
      that a significant proportion of adults in the U.S. may not accept vaccination against&#xD;
      COVID-19. Even more alarming, COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (refusal or reluctance to accept a&#xD;
      vaccine) appears to be increasing as the vaccine approval process becomes increasingly&#xD;
      politicized. Just as efforts to develop vaccine production and delivery capacity have been&#xD;
      undertaken in advance of having a proven effective vaccine, parallel efforts are needed to&#xD;
      identify effective messages and communication strategies to overcome COVID-19 vaccine&#xD;
      hesitancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team recently surveyed a nationally representative sample of approximately 1,000&#xD;
      adults in the United States and found that only 57% intended to be vaccinated when a&#xD;
      coronavirus vaccine becomes available. This percentage was even lower among people who&#xD;
      identified as Black or Hispanic (39% and 43% respectively), those with a high school&#xD;
      education or less (46%), and those in the lowest income groups (49% of those reporting a&#xD;
      household income of $30,000 or less, compared to 72% of those reporting a household income of&#xD;
      $100,000 or more). The investigators asked those who indicated they would not or might not&#xD;
      get vaccinated for their reasons and found that some individuals may be willing to be&#xD;
      vaccinated if provided specific information about the vaccine such as side effects and&#xD;
      effectiveness. Others expressed generalized skepticism, fear, and distrust of vaccines, with&#xD;
      some even referring to anti-vaccine conspiracy theories. These findings are consistent with&#xD;
      an extensive body of research documenting that people often do not behave rationally and&#xD;
      highlight the urgent need to proactively develop and test interventions to maximize&#xD;
      vaccination rates when a coronavirus vaccine becomes available. To address this need, in the&#xD;
      present study, the investigators aim to create and test targeted messages to address the&#xD;
      concerns of subgroups of people at risk for not being vaccinated, with the ultimate goal of&#xD;
      maximizing vaccine uptake when a vaccine for COVID-19 becomes available. The investigators&#xD;
      will accomplish this by working with an existing online panel of volunteers, which will allow&#xD;
      efficient, focused data gathering. Results of the survey will provide a nuanced, current&#xD;
      description of how vulnerable adults perceive the coronavirus and available vaccines, which&#xD;
      will be used as the basis for developing messages and communication strategies. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive one of five different versions of a message from a healthcare&#xD;
      provider regarding vaccination. Specific wording and content of these messages will vary&#xD;
      systematically in order to address concerns of those at risk for not being vaccinated. This&#xD;
      project will ultimately result in a set of tested, evidence-derived messages about&#xD;
      vaccination for COVID-19. The investigators will make these messages available, together with&#xD;
      evidence of how these influence members of vulnerable populations' understanding of&#xD;
      vaccination, and disease risk, as well as intent to be vaccinated. The messages will be&#xD;
      freely available for use by organizations and providers seeking to improve communication&#xD;
      about a coronavirus vaccine.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Through survey completion, an average of 12 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>All participants were asked about their intent to be vaccinated against COVID-19 prior to exposure to one of the five physician messages (Response options: Yes, No, Not sure). After participants were randomly assigned to receive one of the five physician messages, reduction in COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was assessed with the question: &quot;Would you get vaccinated at this visit&quot;. Response options included yes, no, not sure. For participants whose initial vaccination intent was &quot;not sure&quot;, a response of &quot;yes&quot; on re-assessment was defined as less hesitant. Response of &quot;not sure&quot; or &quot;yes&quot; were defined as less hesitant for participants whose initial vaccination intent was &quot;no&quot;.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Who Became Less Hesitant About the COVID-19 Vaccine After Receiving a Physician Message</title>
        <description>All participants were asked about their intent to be vaccinated against COVID-19 prior to exposure to one of the five physician messages (Response options: Yes, No, Not sure). After participants were randomly assigned to receive one of the five physician messages, reduction in COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was assessed with the question: &quot;Would you get vaccinated at this visit&quot;. Response options included yes, no, not sure. For participants whose initial vaccination intent was &quot;not sure&quot;, a response of &quot;yes&quot; on re-assessment was defined as less hesitant. Response of &quot;not sure&quot; or &quot;yes&quot; were defined as less hesitant for participants whose initial vaccination intent was &quot;no&quot;.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Limitations include: (1) Inability to assess whether the impact of physician messages in practice would parallel the impact in the hypothetical scenarios used in this study; (2) The use of an online research platform (prolific.co) may limit generalizability of results.</limitations_and_caveats>
