    <textblock>
      This Phase 2 study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      of inhaled TD-0903 compared with a matching placebo in combination with standard of care&#xD;
      (SOC) in hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 associated acute lung injury and&#xD;
      impaired oxygenation.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 of the study includes up to 3 ascending dose cohorts, each comprised of 8 subjects (6&#xD;
      receiving TD-0903 and 2 receiving placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 of the study will evaluate one dose of TD-0903 (selected based on the data from Part&#xD;
      1) as compared with placebo. Part 2 is targeting 198 subjects total.&#xD;

    <measure>Part 2: Number of Respiratory Failure-free Days (RFDs) From Randomization to Day 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>An RFD was defined as a day that a participant was alive and did not require the use of any respiratory support (invasive mechanical ventilation, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, high-flow oxygen devices, or oxygen supplementation) from randomization through Day 28. The number of RFDs was 0 for participants who used respiratory support for 28 days or longer or for participants who died on or before Day 28.&#xD;
A clinical status score of ≤ 4 on a given day was equivalent to an RFD. The clinical status categories and associated scores ranged from 1-8 where a higher score represented a worse outcome. A clinical status score of 4 was defined as a participant who was hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen, but requiring ongoing medical care (whether or not related to COVID-19).</description>

    <measure>Part 2: Change From Baseline in SaO2/FiO2 Ratio on Day 7</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>SaO2/FiO2 ratio was calculated as SaO2 divided by FiO2.</description>

    <measure>Part 2: Number of Participants in Each Category of the 8-point Ordinal Clinical Status Scale on Days 7, 14, 21, and 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 7, 14, 21 and 28</time_frame>
    <description>The clinical status categories and associated scores ranged from 1-8 where a higher score represented a worse outcome. The scale was as follows:&#xD;
Score 1: Not hospitalized, no limitations on activities&#xD;
Score 2: Not hospitalized, but with limitations on activities and/or requiring home oxygen&#xD;
Score 3: Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen, and no longer requiring ongoing medical care&#xD;
Score 4: Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen, but requiring ongoing medical care (whether or not related to COVID-19)&#xD;
Score 5: Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen&#xD;
Score 6: Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen devices&#xD;
Score 7: Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation&#xD;
Score 8: Death</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>235 participants were enrolled across 24 sites in the United States, Brazil, Finland, the Republic of Moldova, Romania, Ukraine and the United Kingdom.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>235 participants were enrolled and 230 participants were randomized and treated with study drug. Within each cohort in Part 1 (multiple-ascending dose design), participants were randomized 3:1, TD-0903 to placebo. During Part 2 (parallel-group design), participants were stratified by baseline age (≤ 60 versus &gt; 60 years), and by concurrent use of antiviral medications (yes or no) at baseline. Within each stratum, participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either TD-0903 or placebo.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Part 2: Number of Respiratory Failure-free Days (RFDs) From Randomization to Day 28</title>
        <description>An RFD was defined as a day that a participant was alive and did not require the use of any respiratory support (invasive mechanical ventilation, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, high-flow oxygen devices, or oxygen supplementation) from randomization through Day 28. The number of RFDs was 0 for participants who used respiratory support for 28 days or longer or for participants who died on or before Day 28.&#xD;
A clinical status score of ≤ 4 on a given day was equivalent to an RFD. The clinical status categories and associated scores ranged from 1-8 where a higher score represented a worse outcome. A clinical status score of 4 was defined as a participant who was hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen, but requiring ongoing medical care (whether or not related to COVID-19).</description>

Score 3: Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen, and no longer requiring ongoing medical care&#xD;

          <title>Part 2: Number of Participants in Each Category of the 8-point Ordinal Clinical Status Scale on Days 7, 14, 21, and 28</title>
          <description>The clinical status categories and associated scores ranged from 1-8 where a higher score represented a worse outcome. The scale was as follows:&#xD;
Score 1: Not hospitalized, no limitations on activities&#xD;
Score 2: Not hospitalized, but with limitations on activities and/or requiring home oxygen&#xD;
Score 3: Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen, and no longer requiring ongoing medical care&#xD;
Score 4: Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen, but requiring ongoing medical care (whether or not related to COVID-19)&#xD;
Score 5: Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen&#xD;
Score 6: Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen devices&#xD;
Score 7: Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation&#xD;
Score 8: Death</description>
