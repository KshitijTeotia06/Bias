      The current study was to develop a software &quot;Line@&quot; based health education program, providing&#xD;
      video-based health information and communication between diabetes patients and health-care&#xD;
      professionals. This study also evaluated its effectiveness on improving glycemic control,&#xD;
      attitude towards diabetes, knowledge about diabetes and self-care for type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      patients in Taiwan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The followings were the hypotheses of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compared to the control group, intervention group receiving &quot;Line&quot; based video education&#xD;
           has a greater improvement on glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compared to the control group, intervention group receiving &quot;Line&quot; based video education&#xD;
           has a greater positive effect on attitude towards diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compared to the control group, intervention group receiving &quot;Line&quot; based video education&#xD;
           has a better understanding on diabetic knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Compared to the control group, intervention group receiving &quot;Line&quot; based video education&#xD;
           has a greater positive effect on self-care activity.&#xD;

      The study was conducted in the Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinic in Taipei Medical&#xD;
      University Wang-Fang Hospital. Patients were referred from physicians if they met the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and consent to join. Written consent and questionnaires were then provided&#xD;
      to the participants after researcher had clearly explained the study purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the seven key points in managing diabetes developed by the association of diabetes&#xD;
      care and education specialist (ADCES), including healthy coping, healthy eating, being&#xD;
      active, monitoring, taking medication, problem solving and reducing risks, the research team&#xD;
      had developed 51 diabetes related health educational videos (available at website of School&#xD;
      of Pharmacy, Taipei Medical University&#xD;
      http://pharmschool.tmu.edu.tw/activity/index.php?type=20). Each video lasted for about 2-3&#xD;
      minutes. According to the content of the videos, it was categorized into 5 domains, including&#xD;
      understanding diabetes, daily care, nutrition care, diabetes drug and diabetes knowledge&#xD;
      related quizzes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in intervention group could attend the video through the line platform. Researcher&#xD;
      would also send 2-3 videos per week with care massage every 2 weeks to the patients. The&#xD;
      general schedule of video was shown in table x. According to various condition, researcher&#xD;
      developed specific video schedule for each patients. For example, patient who was prescribed&#xD;
      with A drug, we would only send the video regarding A drug to this patient but not all of the&#xD;
      video regarding drugs. Schedule for the part of understanding diabetes, daily care, nutrition&#xD;
      care and quizzes was the same among all participants. Due to the quizzes that were put in&#xD;
      week 3, 6, 9 and 12, videos related to general knowledge about diabetes would be send to&#xD;
      patients first to make sure all the quizzes related content had already taught to patients&#xD;
      before the quizzes. Moreover, patients could communicate with the research team and ask&#xD;
      questions through the platform, researcher would provide answers verified by pharmacists or&#xD;
      physicians in one or two days after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size of this study was estimated using G-power (version 3.1). Assuming a power of&#xD;
      80% with two-sided alpha level for detecting the difference between the intervention group&#xD;
      and the control group, at least 64 patients were needed for each group. Considering 20%&#xD;
      dropout rate, the study was designed to have at least 80 patients for each group, 160&#xD;
      patients in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio according to the random allocation sequence generated&#xD;
      prior to the study. Patients with odd number were allocated into control group while even&#xD;
      numbers were allocated into intervention group. The trial was non-blinded because of its&#xD;
      feasibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researcher would not provide any inductive explanation to the patient during filling the&#xD;
      questionnaire. If patient had questions about the items, a detailed explanation and health&#xD;
      education were provided only after finishing the post-test. The returned questionnaires were&#xD;
      collected by the researcher and kept in the Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of&#xD;
      Pharmacy, Taipei Medical University for three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the data were analyzed using SPSS (SPSS Inc. Released 2009. Predictive Analytics Suite&#xD;
      Workstation (PASW) Statistics for Windows, Version 18.0. Chicago: SPSS Inc.). A two-tailed p&#xD;
      value of 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant in the analysis. For personal&#xD;
      characteristics, descriptive analysis was performed. According to the characteristic of data,&#xD;
      Chi-square test and t-test was used for detecting the differences between groups. a Wilcoxon&#xD;
      signed rank test or paired t-tests was performed for the differences in A1C and the scores&#xD;
      between pre and post-test about knowledge, self-care activity and attitude towards diabetes.&#xD;
      A Mann-Whitney test or unpaired t-tests was performed for the mean differences between&#xD;
      control and intervention group. Logistics regression was performed for the correlation&#xD;
      between variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who had finished both pre- and post-assessment would be included for analysis, those&#xD;
      without post-test would be excluded. Missing values were processed by multiple imputation.&#xD;

Each item was rated from 0 to 7. For patients who were prescribed with either oral medication or insulin injection, the total score ranged from 0 to 63. The total score for patients who were taking both oral and insulin medications ranged from 0 to 70. The mean scores were calculated separately according to the total score ranges.

A score of &quot;1&quot; was given if the patient responded with the correct answer and &quot;0&quot; was given for incorrect answer or answered with &quot;Don't know&quot;. For patients who were prescribed with insulin treatment, the total score ranged from 0 to 24, for those without insulin treatment, the total score ranged from 0 to 22. The mean scores were calculated separately according to the total score ranges. A higher score indicated higher level of knowledge about diabetes.</description>

        <description>The Chinese version of Diabetes Care Profile-Attitudes Toward Diabetes Scales (DCP-ATDS) was used for measuring patients' attitude towards diabetes at baseline and 12 weeks. Each item was rated on a five-point Likert scale, the total score was in the range of 23-115, in which higher scores mean patient had better attitudes towards diabetes.</description>

A score of &quot;1&quot; was given if the patient responded with the correct answer and &quot;0&quot; was given for incorrect answer or answered with &quot;Don't know&quot;. For patients who were prescribed with insulin treatment, the total score ranged from 0 to 24, for those without insulin treatment, the total score ranged from 0 to 22. The mean scores were calculated separately according to the total score ranges. A higher score indicated higher level of knowledge about diabetes.</description>
