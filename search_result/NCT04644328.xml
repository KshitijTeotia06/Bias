    <textblock>
      Facebook ads with physician-delivered videos were shown before the Thanksgiving and Christmas&#xD;
      holidays and focused on staying safe during the COVID pandemic by limiting travel and&#xD;
      mask-wearing.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators used Facebook ads to show a 20 second video clip recorded by Massachusetts&#xD;
      General Hospital, Harvard and Lynn Community health center doctors (6 people in all) to&#xD;
      approximately 20,000,000 Facebook users. The ads will be shown before the Thanksgiving and&#xD;
      Christmas holiday and will focus on staying safe - limiting travel and mask-wearing. The&#xD;
      investigators will randomize exposure to the ad campaign at the ZIP code or county level to&#xD;
      ask:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Do the videos change mobility and Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday travel? Do they reduce&#xD;
      the spread of COVID-19?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Are there spillover impacts from the video messages? For example, if individuals decide to&#xD;
      stay home, then do the geographical regions that tend to be visited by people from treated&#xD;
      areas experience any effects, either through information spillovers or through a reduction in&#xD;
      travel?&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A total of 13 states, comprising 829 counties, centrally report COVID-19 cases at the ZCTA level. Two separate experiments were run within the study, one around Thanksgiving and one around Christmas. For each experiment, approximately half of the counties were randomized to high-intensity treatment with the remaining randomized to low-intensity treatment. In high-intensity counties, 3/4 of ZCTAs were treated and 1/4 were not. In low-intensity counties, 1/4 of ZCTAs were treated and 3/4 were not. In treated ZCTAs, Facebook users received ads with messages from physicians and other health personnel urging them to stay home and wear masks to stop the spread of COVID-19. Users in non-treated ZCTAs received no such ads. After exclusions, 820 counties were randomized to high- or low-intensity treatment during Thanksgiving and 767 counties were during Christmas.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>November 26, 2020 (Thanksgiving); December 24-25, 2020 (Christmas); February 2-29, 2020 (Baseline benchmark)</time_frame>
    <description>The change in movement metric is the percent change in distance covered in a day compared to the same day of the week in the benchmark period of February 2-29, 2020, by people who started the day in a particular location. We define holiday travel as travel during the three days preceding each holiday, since the available data does not allow us to compute the impact of the intervention on the return travel (after the holiday). The reason is that the mobility data describes the behavior throughout the day, for people who were in each county that morning. Since the campaign was targeted based on home location, we can only capture its impact on travel away from home, not back home.</description>

    <time_frame>November 26, 2020 (Thanksgiving); December 24-25, 2020 (Christmas)</time_frame>
    <description>The Facebook stay put metric is the percentage of people who stay within a small geographical area (a &quot;tile&quot; of 600m*600m in which they started the day). We use it to compute the share of people leaving home on the day of the holiday (i.e. this variable = 1 - stay put on the day of the holiday).</description>

    <measure>Knowledge of COVID-19 Prevention Message (Recall of ad, Intent to Travel, Mask Wearing and Beliefs About Travel)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to one month</time_frame>
    <description>Facebook will ask a set of users in treated zip codes to answer four survey questions (each user answers only one question each). A small within-zip control group will be held from being treated, enabling comparisons between those who see the videos and those who don't. These questions will be asked a few days after the ad is shown on the User's feed and will include 1) recall of the ad; 2) intention of traveling over holiday; 3) intention of wearing a mask; and 4) beliefs about whether people should travel over holiday.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Average Number of Tiles People Occupy (Mobility Measure)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to one month</time_frame>
    <description>this measures each day &quot;how much people move around by counting the number of level-16 Bing tiles they are seen in within a day. People seen in more tiles are probably moving around more, while people seen in fewer are probably moving around less. Each day take eligible people in a given region and compute the number of distinct tiles they were seen in.&quot; This is aggregated to the county level.</description>

    <description>Treatment: Individuals received approximately 3 Facebook ads over a 2-week period. Each ad contained a short video recorded by a physician using a script that discusses staying safe during the holidays by considering not traveling and using a mask when appropriate.&#xD;
Randomization to treatment: The 13 states which centrally report COVID-19 cases at the ZCTA level contained 829 counties. At Thanksgiving, 9 counties were excluded due to data limitations. At Christmas, 62 counties were excluded due to data limitations and potential negative impacts in rural, conservative areas resulting from polarization in the wake of the 2020 presidential election. Approximately half of the counties were randomized to high-intensity treatment with the remaining randomized to low-intensity treatment. In high-intensity counties, 3/4 of ZCTAs were treated (i.e., Facebook users in those ZCTAs received ads) and 1/4 were not. In low-intensity counties, 1/4 of ZCTAs were treated and 3/4 were not.</description>

      <population>The experiment was run during two periods: Thanksgiving (Period 1) and Christmas (Period 2). During Thanksgiving, 820 counties were analyzed (410 high-intensity, 410 low-intensity). Of these counties, 767 were analyzed during Christmas (386 high-intensity, 381 low-intensity). Fewer counties were analyzed at Christmas because we removed counties in rural, conservative areas from the study due to potential negative impacts resulting from polarization in the wake of the 2020 presidential election.</population>

        <title>Facebook Movement Metric</title>
        <description>The change in movement metric is the percent change in distance covered in a day compared to the same day of the week in the benchmark period of February 2-29, 2020, by people who started the day in a particular location. We define holiday travel as travel during the three days preceding each holiday, since the available data does not allow us to compute the impact of the intervention on the return travel (after the holiday). The reason is that the mobility data describes the behavior throughout the day, for people who were in each county that morning. Since the campaign was targeted based on home location, we can only capture its impact on travel away from home, not back home.</description>

        <population>Rural, conservative counties were excluded during Christmas due to potential negative impacts of treatment resulting from polarization in the wake of the 2020 presidential election. The two periods have been entered as rows to avoid double-counting counties.</population>

            <title>High-Intensity Counties</title>
            <description>Treatment: Individuals received approximately 3 Facebook ads over a 2-week period. Each ad contained a short video recorded by a physician using a script that discusses the importance of staying safe during Thanksgiving or Christmas by considering not traveling and using a mask when appropriate.&#xD;
Randomization to treatment: The investigators randomized exposure to the ad campaign as follows. The 13 states which centrally report COVID-19 cases at the ZCTA level contained 829 counties. At Thanksgiving, 9 counties were excluded due to data limitations; at Christmas, 62 counties were excluded due to data limitations and potential negative impacts of treatment in rural, conservative areas resulting from polarization in the wake of the 2020 presidential election. Approximately half of the counties were randomized to high-intensity treatment with the remaining randomized to low-intensity treatment. In high-intensity counties, 3/4 of ZCTAs were treated (i.e., Facebook users in those ZCTAs received ads) and 1/4 were not. In low-intensity counties, 1/4 of ZCTAs were treated and 3/4 were not.</description>

        <title>Percentage Leaving Home on Day of Holiday</title>
        <description>The Facebook stay put metric is the percentage of people who stay within a small geographical area (a &quot;tile&quot; of 600m*600m in which they started the day). We use it to compute the share of people leaving home on the day of the holiday (i.e. this variable = 1 - stay put on the day of the holiday).</description>

            <description>Treatment: Individuals received approximately 3 Facebook ads over a 2-week period. Each ad contained a short video recorded by a physician using a script that discusses the importance of staying safe during Thanksgiving or Christmas by considering not traveling and using a mask when appropriate.&#xD;
Randomization to treatment: The investigators randomized exposure to the ad campaign as follows. The 13 states which centrally report COVID-19 cases at the ZCTA level contained 829 counties. At Thanksgiving, 9 counties were excluded due to data limitations; at Christmas, 62 counties were excluded due to data limitations and potential negative impacts of treatment in rural, conservative areas resulting from polarization in the wake of the 2020 presidential election. Approximately half of the counties were randomized to high-intensity treatment with the remaining randomized to low-intensity treatment. In high-intensity counties, 3/4 of ZCTAs were treated (i.e., Facebook users in those ZCTAs received ads) and 1/4 were not. In low-intensity counties, 1/4 of ZCTAs were treated and 3/4 were not.</description>
