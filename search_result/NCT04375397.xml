  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute&#xD;
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Lung failure is the main cause of death&#xD;
      related to COVID-19 infection. The main objective of this study was to evaluate if ibrutinib&#xD;
      is safe and can reduce respiratory failure in participants with COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to&#xD;
      evaluate the addition of ibrutinib to supportive care in hospitalized participants who&#xD;
      presented with COVID-19- related pulmonary distress requiring supplemental oxygen.&#xD;
      Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive placebo + supportive care, denoted as&#xD;
      SOC or standard-of-care, or ibrutinib 420 mg + SOC, with randomization stratified by&#xD;
      prescription for remdesivir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were to be treated with either placebo or ibrutinib in addition to supportive&#xD;
      care for up to 28 days unless they met treatment discontinuation criteria and were to be&#xD;
      followed for 58 days following start of therapy or until death, whichever occurred first.&#xD;
      Treatment could have been stopped at the discretion of the treating physician after 14 days&#xD;
      if the participant was clinically stable and had been off supplemental oxygen for &gt; 48 hours.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Alive and Without Respiratory Failure Through Day 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Through Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Respiratory failure is defined as a clinical diagnosis of respiratory failure and initiation of one of the following therapies: endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation; OR extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; OR high-flow nasal cannula oxygen delivery (i.e., reinforced nasal cannula delivering heated, humidified oxygen with fraction of delivered oxygen ≥ 0.5 and flow rates of ≥ 30 L/min); OR non-invasive positive pressure ventilation; OR clinical diagnosis of respiratory failure with initiation of none of these measures only when clinical decision-making is driven solely by resource limitation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the World Health Organization (WHO)-8 Ordinal Scale From Baseline at Study Day 14</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>The WHO-8 is an ordinal scale for clinical improvement with scores ranging from 0 to 8, where a lower score indicates better clinical status. A score of 0 represents uninfected; 1 (ambulatory, no limitation of activities); 2 (ambulatory, limitation of activities); 3 (hospitalized with mild disease, no oxygen therapy); 4 (hospitalized with mild disease, oxygen by mask or nasal prongs); 5 (hospitalized with severe disease, non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen); 6 (hospitalized with severe disease, intubation and mechanical ventilation); 7 (hospitalized with severe disease, ventilation and additional organ support [pressors, renal replacement therapy, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation]); and 8 (death). Negative values indicate improvement from baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Median Reduction in Days Spent on Supplemental Oxygen</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Days spent on supplemental oxygen was set as the date of the participant being off of supplemental oxygen minus the date of initiation of supplemental oxygen + 1 day. If a participant received more than 1 period of supplemental oxygen therapy during the study or switched from supplemental oxygen to a more intensive therapy, then the days spent on supplemental oxygen were to be calculated as the sum of all the periods where the participant was on supplemental oxygen or a more intensive therapy through Day 28. If the date of the first initiation of supplemental oxygen was before Baseline Day 1, then the days spent on supplemental oxygen were to be calculated from Baseline Day 1 to the date of the participant being off the supplemental oxygen. Time on supplemental oxygen was to be imputed to the maximum number of days on study drug (28) for all points following the death of a participant.</description>

    <time_frame>At Study Days 7, 14, 21, and 28</time_frame>
    <description>Respiratory failure is defined as a clinical diagnosis of respiratory failure and initiation of one of the following therapies: endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation; OR extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; OR high-flow nasal cannula oxygen delivery (i.e., reinforced nasal cannula delivering heated, humidified oxygen with fraction of delivered oxygen ≥ 0.5 and flow rates of ≥ 30 L/min), OR non-invasive positive pressure ventilation; OR clinical diagnosis of respiratory failure with initiation of none of these measures only when clinical decision-making is driven solely by resource limitation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mechanical Ventilation-Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Mechanical ventilation-free survival is defined as the number of days from Baseline Day 1 to the date when a participant initiated mechanical ventilation or died, whichever occurred first, during the 28 days post baseline. If the specified event did not occur by Day 28, participants were to be censored. Specifically, a participant without any post-baseline assessment record was to be censored at Baseline Day 1, a participant who prematurely discontinued from study without a record of death or start of mechanical ventilation was to be censored at the earlier timepoint of the date of study discontinuation or Day 28, an ongoing participant in the study without a record of death or start of mechanical ventilation was to be censored at the earlier timepoint of the date of the last evidence that the participant is not on mechanical ventilation or Day 28.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Days on Mechanical Ventilation</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Days spent on mechanical ventilation was defined as the date of the participant being off mechanical ventilation - date of initiation of mechanical ventilation + 1 day. If a participant received more than 1 period of mechanical ventilation during the study or switched from mechanical ventilation to a more intensive therapy, then the days spent on mechanical ventilation were to be calculated as the sum of all the periods where the participant is on mechanical ventilation or a more intensive therapy through Day 28.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Median Duration of Hospitalization</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Median duration of hospitalization is defined as the hospitalization discharge date - hospitalization admission date + 1 day. If a participant was hospitalized more than once during the study then the hospitalization time was to be calculated as the sum of all the periods when the participant was hospitalized through Day 28.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Discharge From Hospital</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Time to discharge from hospital is defined as the number of days from Baseline Day 1 to the date of the last evidence that a participant is last discharged from hospital, during the 28 days post baseline. If the specified event did not occur by Day 28, participants were censored. Specifically, a participant without any postbaseline assessment record was to be censored at Baseline Day 1, a participant who died was to have time to discharge from hospital censored at Day 28, a participant who prematurely discontinued from study without a record of hospitalization discharge was to be censored at the earlier timepoint of the date of study discontinuation or Day 28, an on-going participant in the study without a record of hospitalization discharge was to be censored at the earlier timepoint of the date of the last evidence that the participant is hospitalized or Day 28.</description>

    <measure>Partial Pressure of Oxygen in Arterial Blood (PaO2) to Fraction of Inspired Oxygen (FiO2) Ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>At Study Days 7, 14, 21, and 28</time_frame>
    <description>The PaO2/FiO2 ratio is the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2 in mmHg) to fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2). A PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 300 to 200 is mild, 200 to 100 moderate, and &lt;100 is severe Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Oxygenation Index</measure>
    <time_frame>At Study Days 7, 14, 21, and 28</time_frame>
    <description>The oxygenation index is used to assess the intensity of ventilatory support required to maintain oxygenation. An index of 0 to &lt; 25 is predictive of a good outcome; 25 to &lt;40 indicates a chance of death &gt;40%; and an index of 40 to 1000 warrants consideration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose of study drug until 30 days following last dose of study drug (up to 70 days)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. The investigator assesses the relationship of each event to the use of study. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that, based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as any event that began or worsened in severity on or after the first dose of study drug.</description>

        <description>The WHO-8 is an ordinal scale for clinical improvement with scores ranging from 0 to 8, where a lower score indicates better clinical status. A score of 0 represents uninfected; 1 (ambulatory, no limitation of activities); 2 (ambulatory, limitation of activities); 3 (hospitalized with mild disease, no oxygen therapy); 4 (hospitalized with mild disease, oxygen by mask or nasal prongs); 5 (hospitalized with severe disease, non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen); 6 (hospitalized with severe disease, intubation and mechanical ventilation); 7 (hospitalized with severe disease, ventilation and additional organ support [pressors, renal replacement therapy, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation]); and 8 (death). Negative values indicate improvement from baseline.</description>

        <title>Median Reduction in Days Spent on Supplemental Oxygen</title>
        <description>Days spent on supplemental oxygen was set as the date of the participant being off of supplemental oxygen minus the date of initiation of supplemental oxygen + 1 day. If a participant received more than 1 period of supplemental oxygen therapy during the study or switched from supplemental oxygen to a more intensive therapy, then the days spent on supplemental oxygen were to be calculated as the sum of all the periods where the participant was on supplemental oxygen or a more intensive therapy through Day 28. If the date of the first initiation of supplemental oxygen was before Baseline Day 1, then the days spent on supplemental oxygen were to be calculated from Baseline Day 1 to the date of the participant being off the supplemental oxygen. Time on supplemental oxygen was to be imputed to the maximum number of days on study drug (28) for all points following the death of a participant.</description>

If the specified event did not occur by Day 28, participants were to be censored. Specifically, a participant without any post-baseline assessment record was to be censored at Baseline Day 1, a participant who prematurely discontinued from study without a record of death or start of mechanical ventilation was to be censored at the earlier timepoint of the date of study discontinuation or Day 28, an ongoing participant in the study without a record of death or start of mechanical ventilation was to be censored at the earlier timepoint of the date of the last evidence that the participant is not on mechanical ventilation or Day 28.</description>

          <title>Days on Mechanical Ventilation</title>
          <description>Days spent on mechanical ventilation was defined as the date of the participant being off mechanical ventilation - date of initiation of mechanical ventilation + 1 day. If a participant received more than 1 period of mechanical ventilation during the study or switched from mechanical ventilation to a more intensive therapy, then the days spent on mechanical ventilation were to be calculated as the sum of all the periods where the participant is on mechanical ventilation or a more intensive therapy through Day 28.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. The investigator assesses the relationship of each event to the use of study. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that, based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as any event that began or worsened in severity on or after the first dose of study drug.</description>
