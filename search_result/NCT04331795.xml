  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has a quoted inpatient mortality as high as 25%. This&#xD;
      high mortality may be driven by hyperinflammation resembling cytokine release syndrome (CRS),&#xD;
      offering the hope that therapies targeting the interleukin-6 (IL-6) axis therapies commonly&#xD;
      used to treat CRS can be used to reduce COVID-19 mortality. Retrospective analysis of severe&#xD;
      to critical COVID-19 patients receiving tocilizumab demonstrated that the majority of&#xD;
      patients had rapid resolution (i.e., within 24-72 hours following administration) of both&#xD;
      clinical and biochemical signs (fever and CRP, respectively) of hyperinflammation with only a&#xD;
      single tocilizumab dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Tocilizumab is effective in decreasing signs, symptoms, and laboratory evidence of&#xD;
           COVID-19 pneumonitis in hospitalized, non-critically ill patients with clinical risk&#xD;
           factors for clinical decompensation, intensive care utilization, and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Low-dose tocilizumab is effective in decreasing signs, symptoms, and laboratory evidence&#xD;
           of COVID-19 pneumonitis in hospitalized, non-critically ill patients with and without&#xD;
           clinical risk factors for clinical decompensation, intensive care utilization, and&#xD;
           death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To establish proof of concept that tocilizumab is effective in decreasing signs,&#xD;
           symptoms, and laboratory evidence of COVID-19 pneumonitis in hospitalized,&#xD;
           non-critically ill patients with clinical risk factors for clinical decompensation,&#xD;
           intensive care utilization, and death, as determined by the clinical outcome of&#xD;
           resolution of fever and the biochemical outcome measures of time to CRP normalization&#xD;
           for the individual patient and the rate of patients whose CRP normalize.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To establish proof of concept that low-dose tocilizumab is effective in decreasing&#xD;
           signs, symptoms, and laboratory evidence of COVID-19 pneumonitis in hospitalized,&#xD;
           non-critically ill patients without clinical risk factors for clinical decompensation,&#xD;
           intensive care utilization, and death, as determined by the clinical outcome of&#xD;
           resolution of fever and the biochemical outcome measures of time to CRP normalization&#xD;
           for the individual patient and the rate of patients whose CRP normalize.&#xD;

This diagnosis will be determined by treating physicians on the basis of worsening pulmonary infiltrates on chest imaging as well as clinical deterioration marked by persistent fever, rising supplemental oxygen requirement, declining PaO2/FiO2 ratio, and the need for intensive care such as mechanical ventilation or vasopressor/inotrope medication(s).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of ICU Days</measure>
    <time_frame>Hospitalization, up to 4 weeks after tocilizumab administration</time_frame>
    <description>Number of ICU days is defined as the time period when a patient is admitted to the ICU (defined as the timestamp on the first vital signs collected in an ICU) until they are transferred from the ICU to a non-ICU setting such as a general acute care bed (defined as the timestamp on the first vital signs collected outside an ICU, excepting any &quot;off the floor&quot; vital signs charted from operating rooms or procedure or imaging suites). Death in the ICU will be a competing risk.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Increased Supplemental Oxygen Requirement From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed over hospitalization, up to 4 weeks after tocilizumab administration</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of increased supplemental oxygen requirement from baseline is defined as the time period (number of days) during which the participant requires supplemental oxygen in excess of his/her baseline supplemental oxygen requirement.
