    <textblock>
      OSCAR (Otilimab in Severe COVID-19 Related Disease) is a multi-center, double-blind,&#xD;
      randomized, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of otilimab for the&#xD;
      treatment of severe pulmonary COVID-19 related disease. The study is being conducted in 2&#xD;
      parts (Part 1 and Part 2). Otilimab is a human monoclonal anti-granulocyte macrophage colony&#xD;
      stimulating factor (GM-CSF) antibody that has not previously been tested in participants with&#xD;
      severe pulmonary COVID-19 related disease in Part 1. The aim of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      benefit-risk of a single infusion of otilimab in the treatment of hospitalized participants&#xD;
      with severe COVID-19 related pulmonary disease with new onset hypoxia requiring significant&#xD;
      oxygen support or requiring early invasive mechanical ventilation (less than or equal to [&lt;=]&#xD;
      48 hours before dosing). Participants will be randomized to receive a single intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      infusion of otilimab or placebo, in addition to standard of care.&#xD;

    <measure>Part 1: Percentage of Participants Alive and Free of Respiratory Failure at Day 28</measure>

    <description>Participants were considered alive and free of respiratory failure if they were in category 1, 2, 3, or 4 from the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) modified version ordinal scale adapted from World Health Organization (WHO) scale 2020. The 8-point scale was as follows: 1) Non-hospitalized, no limitation of activity; 2) Non-hospitalized,limitation of activity; 3) Hospitalized, no oxygen therapy; 4) Hospitalized, low-flow oxygen by mask or nasal prongs; 5) Hospitalized, highflow oxygen (greater than or equal to [&gt;=]15 liters per minute [L/min]), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP), non-invasive ventilation; 6) Hospitalized, intubation and mechanical ventilation; 7) Hospitalized, mechanical ventilation plus additional organ support; 8) Death. Higher scale indicates higher intensity of respiratory failure. Percentage values are rounded off.</description>

        <title>Part 1: Percentage of Participants Alive and Free of Respiratory Failure at Day 28</title>
        <description>Participants were considered alive and free of respiratory failure if they were in category 1, 2, 3, or 4 from the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) modified version ordinal scale adapted from World Health Organization (WHO) scale 2020. The 8-point scale was as follows: 1) Non-hospitalized, no limitation of activity; 2) Non-hospitalized,limitation of activity; 3) Hospitalized, no oxygen therapy; 4) Hospitalized, low-flow oxygen by mask or nasal prongs; 5) Hospitalized, highflow oxygen (greater than or equal to [&gt;=]15 liters per minute [L/min]), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP), non-invasive ventilation; 6) Hospitalized, intubation and mechanical ventilation; 7) Hospitalized, mechanical ventilation plus additional organ support; 8) Death. Higher scale indicates higher intensity of respiratory failure. Percentage values are rounded off.</description>

          <description>Participants were alive and free of respiratory failure if they were in category 1, 2, 3 or 4 from the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) modified version ordinal scale adapted from World Health Organization (WHO) scale 2020. The 8-point scale was as follows: 1) Non-hospitalized, no limitation of activity; 2) Non-hospitalized,limitation of activity; 3) Hospitalized, no oxygen therapy; 4) Hospitalized, low-flow oxygen by mask or nasal prongs; 5) Hospitalized, highflow oxygen (&gt;=15L/min), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP), non-invasive ventilation; 6) Hospitalized, intubation and mechanical ventilation; 7) Hospitalized, mechanical ventilation plus additional organ support; 8) Death. Higher scale indicates higher intensity of respiratory failure. Percentage values are rounded off.</description>

The 8-point scale was as follows: 1) Non-hospitalized, no limitation of activity; 2) Non-hospitalized,limitation of activity; 3) Hospitalized, no oxygen therapy; 4) Hospitalized, low-flow oxygen by mask or nasal prongs; 5) Hospitalized, highflow oxygen (&gt;=15L/min), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP), non-invasive ventilation; 6) Hospitalized, intubation and mechanical ventilation; 7) Hospitalized, mechanical ventilation plus additional organ support; 8) Death. Higher scale indicates higher intensity of respiratory failure. Percentage values are rounded off.</description>

The 8-point scale was as follows: 1) Non-hospitalized, no limitation of activity; 2) Non-hospitalized,limitation of activity; 3) Hospitalized, no oxygen therapy; 4) Hospitalized, low-flow oxygen by mask or nasal prongs; 5) Hospitalized, highflow oxygen (&gt;=15L/min), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP), non-invasive ventilation; 6) Hospitalized, intubation and mechanical ventilation; 7) Hospitalized, mechanical ventilation plus additional organ support; 8) Death. Median and inter-quartile range (first quartile and third quartile) of time to recovery from respiratory failure are presented.</description>

The 8-point scale was as follows: 1) Non-hospitalized, no limitation of activity; 2) Non-hospitalized,limitation of activity; 3) Hospitalized, no oxygen therapy; 4) Hospitalized, low-flow oxygen by mask or nasal prongs; 5) Hospitalized, highflow oxygen (&gt;=15L/min), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP), non-invasive ventilation; 6) Hospitalized, intubation and mechanical ventilation; 7) Hospitalized, mechanical ventilation plus additional organ support; 8) Death.
