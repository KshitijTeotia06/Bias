    <description>Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Scores is used to track a person's risk status during stay in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).

Each organ system is assigned a point value from a minimum of 0 (normal) to a maximum of 4 (high degree of dysfunction/failure). The total score corresponds to the sum of the six different scores of the organ systems. In total, the minimum SOFA score is 0 (normal) and the maximum SOFA score is 24 (highest degree dysfunction/failure).</description>

          <description>Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Scores is used to track a person's risk status during stay in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The score is based on six different scores, one each for the respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, coagulation, renal, and neurological systems. Each organ system is assigned a point value from a minimum of 0 (normal) to a maximum of 4 (high degree of dysfunction/failure). Totaling a maximum SOFA score of 24 and minimum of 0.</description>

          <title>Respiratory Rate and Oxygenation Index (ROX)</title>
          <description>The ROX index is the measure of the ratio of pulse oximetry/fraction of inspired oxygen (SpO2/FiO2) to respiratory rate (RR). The ROX index is used as a predictor of the need to intubate in patients receiving HFNC oxygen therapy; performed at 2, 6 and 12 hours. ROX at 2, 6 and 12 hours after HFNC initiation was associated with a lower risk for intubation. For a ROX Index &lt;3.85, risk of HFNC failure is high. If ROX Index 3.85 to &lt;4.88, the scoring could be repeated one or two hours later for further evaluation.</description>

        <title>Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Scores</title>
        <description>Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Scores is used to track a person's risk status during stay in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The score is based on six different scores, one each for the respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, coagulation, renal, and neurological systems. Each organ system is assigned a point value from a minimum of 0 (normal) to a maximum of 4 (high degree of dysfunction/failure). The total score corresponds to the sum of the six different scores of the organ systems. In total, the minimum SOFA score is 0 (normal) and the maximum SOFA score is 24 (highest degree dysfunction/failure).</description>
