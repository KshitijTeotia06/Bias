  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of MAS825 for the&#xD;
      treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) infected patients&#xD;
      with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia and impaired respiratory function.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase 2, randomized, placebo -controlled, participant and investigator blinded,&#xD;
      multi-center study to assess efficacy and safety of MAS825 for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infected patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and impaired respiratory function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consisted of five study periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening / Baseline / Treatment visit (Day -1 to 1): Lasted up to a maximum of 24 hours and&#xD;
      comprised a screening / baseline assessment. This visit was used to confirm that the study&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria were met and served as baseline assessment prior to&#xD;
      randomization. Participants were randomized as soon as possible, but within a maximum of 24&#xD;
      hours after screening in a 1:1 ratio receiving a single intravenous infusion of MAS825 or&#xD;
      placebo in addition to standard of care (SoC) on Day -1 to 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment period (Day 2-15): Study assessments were conducted every 2 days for hospitalized&#xD;
      participants. If participants were discharged from the hospital prior to Day 15, assessments&#xD;
      on the day of discharge were performed according to the schedule listed under Day 15 and&#xD;
      those participants returned to the site for the Day 15 assessment (all other visits between&#xD;
      discharge and Day 15 were omitted).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up (Day 16-29): After completion of the treatment period, participants were observed&#xD;
      until Day 29 or discharged from hospital, whichever was sooner. Study assessments were&#xD;
      conducted every 2 days for domiciled participants. If participants were discharged from&#xD;
      hospital prior to Day 29, a study visit conducted by telephone was performed on Day 29 (all&#xD;
      other visits between discharge and Day 29 were omitted).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety follow-up visit assessment (Day 45): A follow-up visit for safety was conducted at Day&#xD;
      45 if the participant was hospitalized. If participants were discharged from the hospital&#xD;
      prior to Day 45, a study visit was conducted by telephone on Day 45.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Study/Safety follow-up visit assessment (Day 127): A follow-up visit for safety was&#xD;
      conducted at Day 127 if the participant was hospitalized. If participants were discharged&#xD;
      from the hospital prior to Day 127, a study visit was conducted by telephone on Day 127.&#xD;

    <measure>APACHE II Severity of Disease Score on Day 15 or on the Day of Discharge (Whichever is Earlier)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>The APACHE II (&quot;Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II&quot;) is a severity-of-disease classification system. An integer score from 0 to 71 is computed based on several measurements; higher scores correspond to more severe disease and a higher risk of death. In practice, it is rare for any participant to accumulate more than 55 points.&#xD;
APACHE II score was measured on Day 15 or on the day of discharge (whichever was earlier). Participants who died on Day 15 or earlier were assigned the highest observed APACHE II score of any of the participants at any time during the trial (worst case imputation for deaths). Missing data values of the parameters required for the derivation of the APACHE II score were replaced by the last available assessment.</description>

    <measure>Serum C-reactive Protein (CRP) Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, days 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 15</time_frame>
    <description>C-reactive protein (CRP) is a blood test marker for inflammation in the body. It was analyzed on a log-scale fitting a repeated measures mixed model: treatment, visit, stratification factors, visit * treatment and visit * stratification factors as fixed effects and log-transformed baseline score and visit * log-transformed baseline score as continuous covariate. Values reported were back-transformed to original scale.</description>

    <measure>Ferritin Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, days 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 15</time_frame>
    <description>Ferritin is a blood test marker for inflammation in the body. For a standard ferritin test, a normal reading is less than 300 micrograms per liter (μg/L). It was analyzed on a log-scale fitting a repeated measures mixed model: treatment, visit, stratification factors, visit * treatment and visit * stratification factors as fixed effects and log-transformed baseline score and visit * log-transformed baseline score as continuous covariate. Values reported were back-transformed to original scale.</description>

        <title>APACHE II Severity of Disease Score on Day 15 or on the Day of Discharge (Whichever is Earlier)</title>
        <description>The APACHE II (&quot;Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II&quot;) is a severity-of-disease classification system. An integer score from 0 to 71 is computed based on several measurements; higher scores correspond to more severe disease and a higher risk of death. In practice, it is rare for any participant to accumulate more than 55 points.&#xD;
APACHE II score was measured on Day 15 or on the day of discharge (whichever was earlier). Participants who died on Day 15 or earlier were assigned the highest observed APACHE II score of any of the participants at any time during the trial (worst case imputation for deaths). Missing data values of the parameters required for the derivation of the APACHE II score were replaced by the last available assessment.</description>

        <description>Number of participants not requiring mechanical ventilation for survival until Day 15 and Day 29: defined by WHO 9-point ordinal scale score of &lt; 6 points at all time points assessments.&#xD;
The scoring is - Uninfected patients have a score 0. - Ambulatory patients can have a score 1 (no limitation of activities) or 2 (limitation of activities). - Hospitalized patients with mild disease can have score 3 (no oxygen therapy) or 4 (oxygen by mask or nasal prongs). - Hospitalized patients with severe disease can have score 5 (non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen), 6 (intubation and mechanical ventilation) or 7 (ventilation + additional organ support). - Patients who die have a score 8.&#xD;
Missing data values were handled as follows: For participants who died prior to Day 29, the score for death was imputed for all following visits up to and including Day 29. For all the other participants, last observation carried forward was applied up to and including Day 29.</description>
