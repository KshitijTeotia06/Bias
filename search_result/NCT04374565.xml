      This is a single arm phase II trial to assess efficacy and confirm safety of infusions of&#xD;
      anti-SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma in hospitalized patients with acute respiratory&#xD;
      symptoms,with or without confirmed interstitial COVID-19 pneumonia by chest Xray or CT. A&#xD;
      total of 29 eligible subjects will be enrolled to receive anti-SARS-CoV-2 plasma.Outcomes&#xD;
      will be compared to hospitalized controls with confirmed COVID-19 disease through&#xD;
      retrospective chart review.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      There are no proven treatments for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and associated pneumonia&#xD;
      caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Recent experience in&#xD;
      China suggests that convalescent immune plasma(CIP)may be an effective treatment for&#xD;
      COVID-19. In the pandemic situation where there are no vaccines for COVID-19, specific&#xD;
      antibodies in convalescent plasma induced by infection may provide passive protective&#xD;
      immunity. Passive antibody therapy was the first immunotherapy dating back to the 1890's for&#xD;
      the treatment of infectious diseases before the development of antibiotics 1940's. Experience&#xD;
      from prior outbreaks with other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-1 shows that such&#xD;
      convalescent plasma contains neutralizing antibodies to the relevant virus. In SARS-CoV-2,&#xD;
      passive antibody therapy from CIP probably provided protection by viral neutralization. CIP&#xD;
      was also used in the 2013 Ebola epidemic. A small non-randomized study in Sierra Leone&#xD;
      revealed a significant increase in survival for who received CIP4. CIP administration is the&#xD;
      only approach that provides immediate immunity to patients who have been exposed or who have&#xD;
      active disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This approach is immediately available from individuals who have recovered, are viral&#xD;
      free,and can donate immune plasma (IP) containing high titer neutralizing antibodies. Passive&#xD;
      antibody therapy can be given to a patient recently exposed or a patient who is developing an&#xD;
      infection with COVID-19 by obtaining plasma units from immune individuals by standard&#xD;
      plasmapheresis using FDA-approved blood banking procedures, cross matching the unit(s) to the&#xD;
      recipients and infusing the unit(s) using standard transfusion procedures for blood products.&#xD;
      Based on the safety and long-term experience with plasma infusions, plasma exchanges, and&#xD;
      other procedures involving plasma or plasma product, this protocol was designed as a phase II&#xD;
      single arm trial that involves the administration of antibodies to a given agent to a&#xD;
      susceptible individual for the purpose of preventing or treating an infectious disease due to&#xD;
      that agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only antibody formulation that is available for emergent use is that found in&#xD;
      convalescent plasma. As more individuals contract COVID-19 and recover, the number of&#xD;
      potential donors will increase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principle of passive antibody therapy is that it is more effective when used for&#xD;
      prophylaxis than for treatment of disease. When used for therapy, antibody is most effective&#xD;
      when administered shortly after the onset of symptoms. The reason for temporal variation in&#xD;
      efficacy is not well understood but could reflect that passive antibody works by neutralizing&#xD;
      the initial inoculum, which is likely to be much smaller than that of established disease.&#xD;
      Alternatively, antibodies may dampen the early inflammatory response leaving the infected&#xD;
      individual asymptomatic. For example, antibody therapy for pneumococcal pneumonia was most&#xD;
      effective when given shortly after the onset of symptoms and was of no benefit if antibody&#xD;
      therapy was delayed beyond the third day of disease. For passive antibody therapy to be&#xD;
      effective, a sufficient amount of antibody must be infused. The antibody will circulate in&#xD;
      the blood, reach tissues,and provide protection against infection. Depending on the type of&#xD;
      antibody, amount, and composition, the half-life can vary from weeks to months. It is under&#xD;
      these circumstances, the investigators plan to treat patients who are sick enough to be&#xD;
      hospitalized before the onset of overwhelming disease involving a systemic inflammatory&#xD;
      response, sepsis, and/or ARDS.&#xD;

High-Titer Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (COVID 19) Convalescent Plasma: Pathogen reduced SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma (1-2 units; ~200 mL each for a total of 200-400mls) given preferably in one day, but allowable to be given over 2 days if clinical circumstances delay infusions in 1 day), with titer to be determined after the unit has been infused.</description>
