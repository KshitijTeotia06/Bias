  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ACTT-4 will evaluate the combination of baricitinib and remdesivir compared to dexamethasone&#xD;
      and remdesivir. Subjects will be assessed daily while hospitalized. If the subjects are&#xD;
      discharged from the hospital, they will have a study visit at Days 15, 22, and 29. For&#xD;
      discharged subjects, it is preferred that the Day 15 and 29 visits are in person to obtain&#xD;
      safety laboratory tests, oropharyngeal (OP) swabs, plasma (Day 29), and serum for secondary&#xD;
      research as well as clinical outcome data. However, if infection control or other&#xD;
      restrictions limit the ability of the subject to return to the clinic, these visits may be&#xD;
      conducted by phone, and only clinical data will be obtained. The Day 22 visit does not have&#xD;
      laboratory tests or collection of samples and is conducted by phone. The primary objective is&#xD;
      to evaluate the clinical efficacy of baricitinib + remdesivir versus dexamethasone +&#xD;
      remdesivir as assessed by the mechanical ventilation free survival by Day 29.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an adaptive randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of novel therapeutic agents in hospitalized adults diagnosed with&#xD;
      COVID-19. The study is a multicenter trial that will be conducted in up to approximately 100&#xD;
      sites globally. The study will compare different investigational therapeutic agents to a&#xD;
      control arm. New arms can be introduced according to scientific and public health needs.&#xD;
      There will be interim monitoring to allow early stopping for futility, efficacy, or safety.&#xD;
      If one therapy proves to be efficacious, then this treatment may become the control arm for&#xD;
      comparison(s) with new experimental treatment(s). Any such change would be accompanied by an&#xD;
      updated sample size. This adaptive platform is used to rapidly evaluate different&#xD;
      therapeutics in a population of those hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19. The&#xD;
      platform will provide a common framework sharing a similar population, design, endpoints, and&#xD;
      safety oversight. New stages with new therapeutics can be introduced. One independent Data&#xD;
      and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will actively monitor interim data in all stages to make&#xD;
      recommendations about early study closure or changes to study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACTT-4 will evaluate the combination of baricitinib and remdesivir compared to dexamethasone&#xD;
      and remdesivir. Subjects will be assessed daily while hospitalized. If the subjects are&#xD;
      discharged from the hospital, they will have a study visit at Days 15, 22, and 29. For&#xD;
      discharged subjects, it is preferred that the Day 15 and 29 visits are in person to obtain&#xD;
      safety laboratory tests, oropharyngeal (OP) swabs, plasma (Day 29), and serum for secondary&#xD;
      research as well as clinical outcome data. However, if infection control or other&#xD;
      restrictions limit the ability of the subject to return to the clinic, these visits may be&#xD;
      conducted by phone, and only clinical data will be obtained. The Day 22 visit does not have&#xD;
      laboratory tests or collection of samples and is conducted by phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will undergo a series of efficacy, safety, and laboratory assessments. Safety&#xD;
      laboratory tests and blood (serum and plasma) research samples and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs&#xD;
      will be obtained on Days 1 (prior to infusion) and Days 3, 5, 8, and 11 (while hospitalized).&#xD;
      OP swabs and blood (serum only) plus safety laboratory tests will be collected on Day 15 and&#xD;
      29 (if the subject attends an in-person visit or are still hospitalized).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of baricitinib + remdesivir versus&#xD;
      dexamethasone + remdesivir as assessed by the mechanical ventilation free survival by Day 29.&#xD;
      The key secondary objective is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of baricitinib + remdesivir&#xD;
      versus dexamethasone + remdesivir according to clinical status (8-point ordinal scale) at Day&#xD;
      15.&#xD;

          <title>Remdesivir Plus Baricitinib</title>
          <description>200 mg of remdesivir administered intravenously on Day 1, followed by a 100 mg once-daily maintenance dose of remdesivir while hospitalized for up to a 10-day total course; 4 mg of baricitinib administered as 2 tablets taken orally daily while hospitalized for up to a 14-day total course; and dexamethasone placebo administered as an intravenous injection daily while hospitalized for up to a 10-day total course.&#xD;
Baricitinib: Baricitinib is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor with the chemical name [1-(ethylsulfonyl)-3-(4-(7Hpyrrolo(2,3-d)pyrimidin-4-yl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)azetidin-3-yl]acetonitrile. Each tablet contains 2 mg of baricitinib and the following inactive ingredients: croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate, mannitol, microcrystalline cellulose, ferric oxide, lecithin (soya), polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl alcohol, talc and titanium dioxide.&#xD;
Placebo: Placebo matching intravenous dexamethasone.&#xD;
Remdesivir: Drug remdesivir is a single diastereomer monophosphoramidate prodrug designed for the intracellular delivery of a modified adenine nucleoside analog GS-441524. In addition to the active ingredient, the lyophilized formulation of remdesivir contains the following inactive ingredients: water for injection, sulfobutylether beta-cyclodextrin sodium (SBECD), and hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide.</description>

        <population>The mITT population includes all participants by their randomized treatment assignment and baseline ordinal score. For missing data, if results were available for visits before or after that visit, the average of the two nearest visits was imputed. If a participant died or was lost to follow-up, their last available observation was carried forward. If baseline was missing, the earliest post-treatment dose was used.

        <description>Blood to evaluate d-dimer concentration was collected at Days 1, 3, 5, 8, and 11 while participants were inpatient, and at Days 15 and 29, with the Day 1 assessment serving as baseline. Participants who had been discharged had blood collected if infection control measures allowed for in-person visits after discharge.</description>

        <population>The mITT population includes all participants by their randomized treatment assignment and baseline ordinal score. For any missing data, if results were available for visits before or after that visit, the average of the two nearest visits was imputed for all missing visits between them. If a participant died or was lost to follow-up, their last available observation was carried forward. If baseline was missing, another pre-treatment dose was used, or the earliest post-treatment dose was used.</population>

        <description>The ordinal scale is an assessment of the clinical status at the first assessment of a given study day. The scale is as follows: 8) Death; 7) Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO; 6) Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices; 5) Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen; 4) Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - requiring ongoing medical care (COVID-19 related or otherwise); 3) Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - no longer requires ongoing medical care; 2) Not hospitalized, but has new or increased limitation on activities and/or new or increased requirement for home oxygen over baseline, pre-COVID-19 status; 1) Not hospitalized, participant is back to their baseline, pre-COVID-19 status, that is, no new or increased limitations on activities and no new or increased oxygen use.</description>

The scale is as follows: 8) Death; 7) Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO; 6) Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices; 5) Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen; 4) Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - requiring ongoing medical care (COVID-19 related or otherwise); 3) Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - no longer requires ongoing medical care; 2) Not hospitalized, but has new or increased limitation on activities and/or new or increased requirement for home oxygen over baseline, pre-COVID-19 status; 1) Not hospitalized, patient is back to their baseline, pre-COVID-19 status, that is, no new or increased limitations on activities and no new or increased oxygen use. Time to improvement by at least one category was determined for each participant.</description>
