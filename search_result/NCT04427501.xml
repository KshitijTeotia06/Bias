  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure how well LY3819253 and LY3832479 work against the&#xD;
      virus that causes COVID-19. LY3819253 and LY3832479 will be given to participants with early&#xD;
      symptoms of COVID-19. Samples will be taken from the back of the nose to determine how much&#xD;
      virus is in the body at various times during the study. Participation could last about 12&#xD;
      weeks and includes one required visit to the study site, with the remainder of assessments&#xD;
      performed in the home or by phone.&#xD;

    <measure>Phase 2: Change From Baseline to Day 11 in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Viral Load</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 11</time_frame>
    <description>SARS-CoV-2 viral load was based on nasopharyngeal swab sampling for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2. Least squares (LS) mean values were determined using a mixed-effects model repeated-measures (MMRM) that included log base 10 transformed baseline as a covariate, treatment, day, treatment-by-day interaction as fixed effects. If Day 11 SARS-CoV-2 viral load was missing, the earliest measurement closest to the Day 11 visit, but within 4 days (Day 7-Day 15), was used for the Day 11 value. If no measurements were available, the Day 11 viral load was treated as missing at random (MAR) in the analysis.&#xD;
Viral load is reported as normalized viral load and is unitless.</description>

    <measure>Phase 3: Percentage of Participants Demonstrating Symptom Resolution</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 11</time_frame>
    <description>Symptoms associated with COVID-19 were evaluated using a questionnaire that contains the following symptoms: cough, shortness of breath, feeling feverish, fatigue, body aches and pain, sore throat, chills, headache, loss of appetite, and changes in taste and smell. Each symptom was scored daily by the participant as experienced during the past 24 hours with following rating and score: None or absent (0), Mild (1), Moderate (2) and Severe (3). Symptom resolution (yes/no) is defined as a score of 0 for shortness of breath, feeling feverish, body aches and pains, sore throat, chills, and headache; and a score of 0 or 1 for cough and fatigue on the symptom questionnaire (excluding the loss of appetite and changes in taste and smell symptoms). Missing data were imputed using non-responder imputation (NRI) method.</description>

        <title>Phase 2: Change From Baseline to Day 11 in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Viral Load</title>
        <description>SARS-CoV-2 viral load was based on nasopharyngeal swab sampling for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2. Least squares (LS) mean values were determined using a mixed-effects model repeated-measures (MMRM) that included log base 10 transformed baseline as a covariate, treatment, day, treatment-by-day interaction as fixed effects. If Day 11 SARS-CoV-2 viral load was missing, the earliest measurement closest to the Day 11 visit, but within 4 days (Day 7-Day 15), was used for the Day 11 value. If no measurements were available, the Day 11 viral load was treated as missing at random (MAR) in the analysis.&#xD;
Viral load is reported as normalized viral load and is unitless.</description>

          <title>Phase 2: Change From Baseline to Day 11 in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Viral Load</title>
          <description>SARS-CoV-2 viral load was based on nasopharyngeal swab sampling for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2. Least squares (LS) mean values were determined using a mixed-effects model repeated-measures (MMRM) that included log base 10 transformed baseline as a covariate, treatment, day, treatment-by-day interaction as fixed effects. If Day 11 SARS-CoV-2 viral load was missing, the earliest measurement closest to the Day 11 visit, but within 4 days (Day 7-Day 15), was used for the Day 11 value. If no measurements were available, the Day 11 viral load was treated as missing at random (MAR) in the analysis.&#xD;
Viral load is reported as normalized viral load and is unitless.</description>

        <description>Symptoms associated with COVID-19 were evaluated using a questionnaire that contains the following symptoms: cough, shortness of breath, feeling feverish, fatigue, body aches and pain, sore throat, chills, headache, loss of appetite, and changes in taste and smell. Each symptom was scored daily by the participant as experienced during the past 24 hours with following rating and score: None or absent (0), Mild (1), Moderate (2) and Severe (3). Symptom resolution (yes/no) is defined as a score of 0 for shortness of breath, feeling feverish, body aches and pains, sore throat, chills, and headache; and a score of 0 or 1 for cough and fatigue on the symptom questionnaire (excluding the loss of appetite and changes in taste and smell symptoms). Missing data were imputed using non-responder imputation (NRI) method.</description>

        <title>Phase 3: Percentage of Participants Demonstrating Symptom Improvement</title>
        <description>Symptoms associated with COVID-19 were evaluated using a questionnaire that contains the following symptoms: cough, shortness of breath, feeling feverish, fatigue, body aches and pain, sore throat, chills, headache, loss of appetite, and changes in taste and smell. Each symptom will be scored daily by the participant as experienced during the past 24 hours with following rating and score: None or absent (0), Mild (1), Moderate (2) and Severe (3). Symptom improvement was defined as a participant experiencing both: Symptoms on the symptom questionnaire scored as moderate or severe at baseline are subsequently scored as mild or absent, and symptoms on the symptom questionnaire scored as mild or absent at baseline are subsequently scored as absent. Missing data were imputed using NRI method.</description>

        <title>Phase 3: Change From Baseline to Day 7 in SARS-CoV-2 Viral Load</title>
        <description>Change from baseline to Day 7 (±2 days) in SARS-CoV-2 viral load was based on nasopharyngeal swab sampling for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2. Least squares (LS) mean values were determined using a mixed-effects model repeated-measures (MMRM) that included log base 10 transformed baseline as a covariate, treatment, day, treatment-by-day interaction as fixed effects. If Day 7 SARS-CoV-2 viral load was missing, the earliest measurement closest to the Day 7 visit, but within 2 days (Day 5-Day 9), was used for the Day 7 value. If no measurements are available, the Day 7 viral load was treated as missing at random (MAR) in the analysis.&#xD;

        <description>Sustained symptom resolution was defined as 2 consecutive assessments with a score of 0 for shortness of breath, feeling feverish, body aches and pains, sore throat, chills, and headache; and a score of 0 or 1 for cough and fatigue on the symptom questionnaire. Participants who did not experience sustained symptom resolution by completion or early discontinuation of study were censored at the date of their last visit during. Additionally, participants who were hospitalized were censored at their date of hospitalization.</description>

        <title>Phase 2: Change From Baseline to Day 11 in SARS-CoV-2 Viral Load Among Participants Enrolled With Recent Symptoms Prior to Randomization</title>
        <description>SARS-CoV-2 viral load was based on nasopharyngeal swab sampling for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2. This analysis included only participants whose symptoms developed no more than 8 days prior to randomization. Least squares (LS) mean values were determined using a mixed-effects model repeated-measures (MMRM) that included log base 10 transformed baseline as a covariate, treatment, day, treatment-by-day interaction as fixed effects. If Day 11 SARS-CoV-2 viral load is missing, the earliest measurement closest to the Day 11 visit, but within 4 days (Day 7-Day 15), will be used for the Day 11 value. If no measurements are available, the Day 11 viral load will be treated as MAR in the analysis.</description>

        <description>Symptoms associated with COVID-19 were evaluated using a questionnaire that contains the following symptoms: cough, shortness of breath, feeling feverish, fatigue, body aches and pain, sore throat, chills, headache, loss of appetite, and changes in taste and smell. Each symptom will be scored daily by the participant as experienced during the past 24 hours with following rating and score: None or absent (0), Mild (1), Moderate (2) and Severe (3). Symptom resolution was defined as all symptoms (those scored 0-3) on the symptom questionnaire scored as absent (0). Symptom Resolution (yes/no) was defined as all symptoms (excluding the loss of appetite and changes in taste and smell symptoms) on the symptom questionnaire scored as absent vs otherwise.&#xD;

Each symptom will be scored daily by the participant as experienced during the past 24 hours with following rating and score: None or absent (0), Mild (1), Moderate (2) and Severe (3). Symptom improvement was defined as a participant experiencing both: Symptoms on the symptom questionnaire scored as moderate or severe at baseline are subsequently scored as mild or absent, and Symptoms on the symptom questionnaire scored as mild or absent at baseline are subsequently scored as absent. Missing data were imputed using NRI method.</description>

          <description>Symptoms associated with COVID-19 were evaluated using a questionnaire that contains the following symptoms: cough, shortness of breath, feeling feverish, fatigue, body aches and pain, sore throat, chills, headache, loss of appetite, and changes in taste and smell. Each symptom will be scored daily by the participant as experienced during the past 24 hours with following rating and score: None or absent (0), Mild (1), Moderate (2) and Severe (3). Symptom improvement was defined as a participant experiencing both: Symptoms on the symptom questionnaire scored as moderate or severe at baseline are subsequently scored as mild or absent, and Symptoms on the symptom questionnaire scored as mild or absent at baseline are subsequently scored as absent. Missing data were imputed using NRI method.</description>
