  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal for this study is to assess whether receiving the results of an antibody&#xD;
      test changes protective behavior to avoid SARS-CoV-2 infections (i.e., mask-wearing, physical&#xD;
      distancing, limiting close contacts/avoiding crowds, hand-washing, avoiding contact with&#xD;
      high-risk individuals). While studies have been published on the cross-sectional relationship&#xD;
      between risk perception and other demographic characteristics and health behaviors that are&#xD;
      protective for SARS-CoV-2 infection (see citations), there have been no studies showing the&#xD;
      effect of receiving information about antibody positivity on protective behavior. Not only&#xD;
      can results from this study be used to better model transmission, a better understanding of&#xD;
      college student's risk perception around SARS-CoV-2 infections has implications for future&#xD;
      vaccination strategies as well. There are concerns that a desire to return to &quot;normal&quot; life&#xD;
      in combination with reduced perception of risk could have negative consequences for uptake of&#xD;
      vaccination (Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security 2020 report, The Public's Role in&#xD;
      COVID-19 Vaccination: Planning Recommendations Informed by Design Thinking and the Social,&#xD;
      Behavioral, and Communication Sciences).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The antibody test used in this study is named 'SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG rapid assay kit (Colloidal&#xD;
      Gold)'. It provides a fast, on-site, and accurate detection of IgM/IgG antibodies against&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2, with positive results of IgM antibodies indicating a recent infection, while&#xD;
      positive results of IgG antibodies signaling a longer or previous infection. It can detect&#xD;
      IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in human specimens of serum, plasma, or venous&#xD;
      whole blood.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will take place between September - November, 2020, and will ask participants to&#xD;
      participate in: a web-based baseline survey, two rounds of SARS-CoV-2 serological testing&#xD;
      (September and November), and bi-weekly web-based behavioral surveys (4 total surveys). Each&#xD;
      is described in more detail below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Web-based baseline survey: The baseline survey is designed to collect data on participant&#xD;
      demographics, SARS-CoV-2 protective behaviors, alcohol drinking habits, nicotine use, and&#xD;
      personality profile and should take less than 30 minutes to fill out. Participants who&#xD;
      provide informed consent will be provided the link to the survey which they can fill out at a&#xD;
      time convenient to them prior to first round of serological testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 serological testing: There will be two rounds of SARS-CoV-2 serological testing,&#xD;
      once at baseline (September 14-23) and once at endline (November 9-11). The serological&#xD;
      testing visits will involve in-person laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The&#xD;
      laboratory test involves a fingerstick to provide a small blood sample for the antibody test&#xD;
      kits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibody test results will eventually be provided to all study participants via secure link&#xD;
      sent by email. With this message, we will include a clearly written information sheet about&#xD;
      the chance for inaccurate test results and how it is still unknown whether previous&#xD;
      infections confer immunity to future infections. We will clearly counsel participants to not&#xD;
      use the results of the tests as proof of a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, nor as a reason to&#xD;
      change their behaviors. If participants wish to participate in the study, but do not wish to&#xD;
      be provided with their antibody test results, they will be able to opt out of the results&#xD;
      provision. If any participants opt out of receiving their test results, these participants&#xD;
      would essentially create a third category of respondents: those who do not receive their&#xD;
      results at all. However, these participants will still be analyzed with the trial arm to&#xD;
      which they were randomized (intent to treat analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary experiment will assess whether provision of the antibody test results leads to&#xD;
      behavior change with respect to personal protective behaviors. To that end, all participants&#xD;
      will be randomized to a trial arm that immediately receive results (within 24 hours) or a&#xD;
      trial arm with a delayed provision of results (after 4 weeks). So as to not incentivize early&#xD;
      drop-out, if a participant in the delayed results arm drops out early, they will still be&#xD;
      provided their test results at the regularly scheduled time, not earlier. All other&#xD;
      procedures between arms are identical. The endline laboratory test results will be delivered&#xD;
      to all participants in the same timeframe - within 24-72 hours. The early and delayed test&#xD;
      result intervention will have completed after the first round of testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Web-based behavioral surveys: To assess whether or not the provision of antibody test results&#xD;
      changes behaviors, participants will self-reported behaviors in a short web-based survey&#xD;
      every two weeks under observation. Links to these surveys will be sent to participants at&#xD;
      regular bi-weekly intervals. Participants will fill out these short follow-up surveys on&#xD;
      their computers or mobile devices. They are designed to take about 5 minutes or less to&#xD;
      complete for each survey.&#xD;

      <recruitment_details>We randomly sampled 7,499 students from the sampling frame of all IU Bloomington undergraduates enrolled at the beginning of the Fall 2020 semester. Students in the sample were eligible to participate if they were (1) aged 18 years or older, (2) a current IU Bloomington undergraduate student, and (3) currently residing in Monroe County, Indiana. Of those sampled, 4,069 potential participants met the inclusion criteria for the study and were contacted by email with a study invitation.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Following the study invitation, 1076 of the 4069 eligible sampled students were enrolled in the study and received randomization. 2651 students tacitly refused participation, 21 students explicitly refused participation or withdrew from the study, and 321 students missed the baseline study visit.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>This outcome will be assessed by comparing SARS-CoV-2 serostatus at baseline (September 2020) and endline (November 2020). Those who were antibody negative at baseline but antibody positive at endline will be considered seroconverters in this study.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>As results were disseminated by email, we cannot confirm that everyone in each treatment condition received their results on the expected schedule, or at all. However, operational and survey data we collected indicated that participants received their test results at similar rates in both arms, alleviating concerns of differential intervention uptake.</limitations_and_caveats>
